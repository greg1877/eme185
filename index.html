<h3>Course Philosophy<a class="headerlink" href="#course-philosophy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This course differs from almost all other courses that you have taken at the
university in that there is no predetermined list of theories, facts, or
physical laws that you are expected to learn and master. The sole objective of
the design project course is to provide you with an opportunity to use your own
skills and knowledge to solve an engineering design problem. This experience
will help you make the transition from school to work; i.e., to bridge the gap
between theory and applications.</p>
<p>You are expected to attend every class, to use your own initiative to plan your
own outside work schedule, both in class and outside of class, and to complete
various major design project phases by their deadlines. Your instructors should
be viewed as consultants and not as a taskmasters; they will not direct your
work effort or make your decisions, but are there to assist you with technical
engineering problems.</p>
<p>In 185A, a one-hour lecture is used each week to present material related to
the design process. Additionally, a 3-hour studio is used for group
activities, supplemental lecture material, and individual group meetings with
the instructors. Groups will follow the design process in their respective
projects. Groups are expected to meet regularly outside of formal class hours.
Groups will additionally meet with their instructors on a regular basis during
the quarter for direction, group presentations, and design reviews. Based on
the nature of the project, some groups will also meet with industry sponsors on
a regular basis. Towards the end of the quarter, sessions will be scheduled for
project presentations to the entire class.</p>
<p>In 185B, each group will register for a block of time for both meetings with
the instructor and to allow a common time for group meetings. Also, each group
will meet weekly with their project's faculty mentor. Additionally, many of the
projects will require group meetings with their corporate sponsors, and these
are additionally arranged based on everyone's schedules. There will be no
formal lecture time scheduled for 185B. During approximately the last week of
185B class, the teams will present a poster at the College of Engineering's
Design Showcase.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="student-s-role-responsibility">
<h3>Student's Role &amp; Responsibility<a class="headerlink" href="#student-s-role-responsibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each student should view their role as that of an engineer as part of a design
team charged with the responsibility of managing and completing a design
project. As such you must do whatever is necessary to carry out this
responsibility. Specifically, your group must carry a design project from the
conception stage through the presentation stage. You are also responsible for
all written and oral reports and materials required by your instructor. Some
projects may require the fabrication of feasibility test components and/or
first generation prototype components. This may be accomplished through a
combination of student work in the engineering student faculty shop and/or the
corporate sponsor accepting this responsibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="instructors-role-responsibility">
<h3>Instructors' Role &amp; Responsibility<a class="headerlink" href="#instructors-role-responsibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your instructors mentor have two primary responsibilities. First, they will
serve as an engineering consultant to the design project teams. In this
capacity, they expect to be kept informed of your project progress, have
discussions about design concepts and problems, point out appropriate reference
materials, suggest analysis methods, etc. They will not make engineering
decisions that they feel are rightly the responsibility of the design project
engineers, and they will generally play the role of devil's advocate in your
decision making process. Every student should keep in mind that the best time
to use your consultant is before your problem becomes unmanageable.</p>
<p>Your instructors' second responsibility is to evaluate your performance and
your design solution to the project. This is done by periodic review of your
progress (written and/or oral reports) and especially by evaluation of your
Final Design Project Report at the end of the second quarter. It should be
noted that each project's sponsor will provide feedback that may contribute to
final grading as well.</p>

<h2>Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This class requires a lot of communication: among your team, with your
sponsors, with your mentors, and with the instructors. This can quickly get
unmanageable, especially for the instructors' email inboxes. So here are some
simple rules to follow with respect to communication:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Canvas Discussions</dt>
<dd>This is the first place to ask questions. Use this forum to ask questions
that are general for the class. Try to restructure your less general
questions into general ones so you can ask here. This minimizes the number
of times a question has to be answered and allows both students and
instructors to collectively answer questions.</dd>
<dt>Email</dt>
<dd>Use email for individualized communication, i.e. for questions about project
specifics or other personal needs. Email your TA first before you email the
primary instructor. Do not copy any of the instructors into your email
conversations among your team or with your sponsors. We are your technical
consultants, only email us when you have a specific question that you need
help answering. Lastly, all emails to the instructors must prepend
&quot;[EME185]&quot; to their subject line.</dd>
<dt>Class</dt>
<dd>You will get to meet with the instructors during the studio time. You must
prepare an <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/meetings.html">AIO</a> for the meeting. You will get at least 15 minutes of time
from your TA and 15 minutes every other week with the primary instructor.</dd>
<dt>Office Hours</dt>
<dd>The primary instructor will hold office hours in which you can schedule up
to a 30 minute block for your team to meet.</dd>
<dt>Appointments</dt>
<dd>You may schedule an appointment with any of the instructors if all of the
above doesn't work for some reason. Use this as a last resort.</dd>
