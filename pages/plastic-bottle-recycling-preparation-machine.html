    <h2><a href="http://mae.ucdavis.edu">MAE, UC Davis</a>, Davis, CA, USA</h2>
    <p><strong>ID:</strong> bottlecap</p>
    <p><strong>Relevant Skills:</strong> mechanical design</p>
    
    <p>Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are collected in recycling
bins and transported to recycling centers for reuse and to reduce the amount of
waste going into landfills. In an effort to reduce cost of recycling, many
local governments and waste collection agencies collect PET bottles separately
from other household waste. At present, the collected PET bottles are taken to
recycling centers where the labels and plastic caps are separated before being
washed and shredded into PET flakes to be used as raw material for a range of
products. In Japan, the caps of plastic drinking bottles must be removed from
the bottle and placed into separate recycling bins. See below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/bottlecap-01.jpg" style="width: 300px;" />
</div>
<p>This is problematic because most people are too lazy or indifferent to remove
the cap and properly dispose of the two items from each bottle.</p>
<div class="section" id="objective">
<h2>Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#objective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The task in this project is to design and manufacture a recycling bin that
incorporates a machine that separates the cap from the bottle and then sorts
the two items into different bins. PET drink customers trash the PET bottles
(500 ml) in random directions and the machine should be capable of fulfilling
the task automatically using a single motor. The device will have to fit in the
same dimensions as a typical recycling receptacle and be able to properly deal
with a bottle that is tossed in by a user.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evaluation">
<h2>Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Evaluation is based on processing speed, efficiency (success rate), and the
energy requirement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cultural-exchange">
<h2>Cultural Exchange<a class="headerlink" href="#cultural-exchange" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A team of Japanese engineering students at Meijo University is also working on
a design for this machine independently of the UC Davis team. The Japanese
students will bring their completed machine to the UC Davis Engineering Design
Showcase to compete with the UCD team. The teams will compete and they will
have to create a presentation for the opposing team that elaborates on how and
why they created their particular solution.</p>
