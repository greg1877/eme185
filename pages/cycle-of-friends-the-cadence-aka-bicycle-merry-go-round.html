<h2>Design, Construction and a Human Powered Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#design-construction-and-a-human-powered-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>What does Parks and Recreation have to do with Mechanical engineering?</p>
<p>Franklin County Parks and Recreation is striving to provide needed and new
social offerings for our rural community, create an open and welcoming
environment, and develop quality offerings.&nbsp; In working toward this purpose and
thinking about keeping the fun in everything we do, the idea of making a toy
came to mind. I would like to offer something similar as a platform to unite
people, generate interest in active recreation and even spur on healthy
competition. The bicycle merry go round would be a highlight at Roanoke Go
Outside Festival which drew in nearly 30,000 attendants in Oct of 2016. Parks
and Recreation would also use this at numerous other events and programs
throughout our region. It would be a free offering that is unlike any other.
In making some basic plans I have encountered the geometrical challenges
associated with a project like this.</p>
<p><strong>The challenges</strong> of design and construction of this human powered machine far
exceeds the resources available to our parks and recreation department.  As I
began to sketch out design options for creating a functional bicycle merry go
round I discovered engineering would be best if outsourced. Complicated
engineering, geometry, force distribution and design requirements make for a
unique challenge.</p>
<p><strong>The goal</strong> of this project is to have a functional and portable bicycle merry
go round that can be peddled by adults of varying sizes and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Design requirements</strong> have several specifications but the freedom to make
this project your own should be enticing.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The bicycle merry go round should be constructed for under $1000.00</li>
<li>It should seat 6 to 9 individuals.</li>
<li>Mobility is key! The unit should be able to fit into a 6'W x 6'L x 4'H
shipping container.</li>
<li>It should have the ability to freewheel (coast) but also include individual
breaks.</li>
<li>Bicycles should maintain their natural character (look like bicycles when
finished) and operate like bicycles, minus steering input; and have no
unnatural wheel removal process.</li>
<li>Ideally it will have no central hub (not joined to a central mount) but fixed
end to end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this project requires the students to meet with the client via video
or phone conferencing.</p>
