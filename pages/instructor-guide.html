<li>Please log your weekly hours in a spreadsheet in the Google Drive directory.
I use this information to gauge if I'm giving too much or too little work for
the TA appointment. I also use it to justify request for more TA help for
future courses.</li>
<li>We will have a 1 hour weekly instructor meeting to go over the upcoming
week's activities. Please arrange this to fit our schedules.</li>
<li>If you want to meet with me, check my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">work calendar</a> for an open weekday
slot and send me a request via email.</li>
<li>I strictly use the Linux operating system and strive to use open source tools
for most of my work. I prefer not to have to deal with any Microsoft Office
Suite file types. Please avoid these and choose LibreOffice for Google
equivalents so that we can easily collaborate and share.</li>

<div class="section" id="lectures">
<h2>Lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#lectures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You are not required to attend any of the lecture periods. You are welcome to
sit in on lectures or even give one or more yourself. If you sit in on the
lectures I will ask you to note down feedback for me. If you would like to give
a lecture, just let me know well beforehand and we will make arrangements. Past
TAs have given a lecture to introduce students to useful things (e.g. 3D
printing, microcontrollers) for their projects. I'm happy to give feedback on
your lectures too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="studios">
<h2>Studios<a class="headerlink" href="#studios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will be required to attend all of the studio sessions in the winter
quarter. During these sessions you will meet with your teams, go over their
progress, and help them succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="office-hours">
<h2>Office Hours<a class="headerlink" href="#office-hours" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will be expected to hold office hours each week. These should be convenient
for the homework due dates and not conflict with Jason's office hours. Past TAs
have used Bainer 2071 for the office hours. Provide feedback to Jason about how
well these are attended so that we can adjust if needed.</p>

<h2>Websites<a class="headerlink" href="#websites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="course-website">
<h3>Course Website<a class="headerlink" href="#course-website" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All of the public information about the course should go on the <a class="reference external" href="http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/">course
website</a>.  The website source is at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/eme185">https://github.com/moorepants/eme185</a>.
You'll need to make a Github account and share your user name with Jason to get
access to modify the website and permission to edit the Github issues. See the
README for instructions on editing and viewing the site locally.</p>

<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h3>Canvas<a class="headerlink" href="#canvas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">Canvas</a> will be used for all of the private information related to the course
that is shared with the students, e.g. grades, copyrighted materials,
announcements, roster, email lists, solutions, etc. Request to be added to the
roster as an instructor.</p>
<p>Students should be directed to the Discussions section of the course Canvas
page to ask asynchronous questions electronically (instead of email). Any
question that could benefit more than one student should be asked here, so if
students email you directly, kindly direct them to Discussions. It is the
instructors' responsibility to answer these questions in a timely manner.
Consider enabling email notifications for discussion posts in your Canvas
account preferences.</p>

<div class="section" id="google-drive">
<h3>Google Drive<a class="headerlink" href="#google-drive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will use a Google Drive for collaborative grading and sharing information
among the instructors. This should not be shared outside of the instructors as
it will have FERPA protected information. <strong>You must be extremely careful that
you do not share any document in this drive with any student.</strong></p>

<h2>Reports and Memos<a class="headerlink" href="#reports-and-memos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will be responsible for grading the memos. The purpose of the memos is so
the students pace out the draft writing and that we provide feedback on the
material before it is put in the final report. Jason will provide grading
rubrics.</p>
<p>We will co-grade the reports. There is a grading rubric, each of us will take a
section of the report, and can grade it at our leisure. We will either use
Google Drive to collaboratively annotate the PDFs or use the Canvas
functionality.</p>

</ul>
<p>Each memo has a rubric that is available in Canvas's speed grading tool.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<h2>Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#planning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The lead TA will be responsible for several scheduling tasks.</p>
<div class="section" id="preliminary-design-reviews">
<h3>Preliminary Design Reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#preliminary-design-reviews" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary design reviews take place during week 8 of EME 185A. The design
reviews are 50-minute sessions for teams to present their selected concept to
the instructor and their TA. The timing is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>5 minutes of setup</li>
<li>25 minutes of presentation by the team</li>
<li>20 minutes of Q&amp;A</li>
<li>10 minutes for grading (instructor + TA only)</li>
</ul>
<p>This timing allows the reviews to be scheduled back-to-back in slots that fit
the class schedule (e.g. 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM, 2:10 PM - 3:00 PM, etc.). Getting
the schedule together is difficult logistically, but the following steps should
lead to minimal issues:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Get the instructor's availability.</li>
<li>Find out from the MAE office when small rooms (~10-person capacity) are
available.</li>
<li>Generate a spreadsheet with the common availability from the steps above.</li>
<li>Have the TAs fill in when they are available in blocks. Make sure that
blocks are overlapping to minimize issues.</li>
<li>Send a refined version out to students, instructing them to select only
a slot that their TA has available.</li>
<li>Fix any issues as necessary.</li>
<li>Get the schedule to the MAE office as soon as possible to reserve the rooms
at the selected times.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="b-scheduling">
<h3>185B Scheduling<a class="headerlink" href="#b-scheduling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For the second quarter of senior design, each team will meet weekly with their
TA and the instructor for 55 minutes. This requires a small room for about 10
people with an AV system and preferably a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Scheduling for these weekly meetings is somewhat similar to scheduling the
design reviews, but it may be useful to ask for room availability in large
blocks so back-to-back meetings don't require the instructors to move around.</p>
<p>One extra concern for Spring quarter scheduling is Memorial Day. One solution
is to make it clear to students when they sign up for a meeting time that they
will have to move that week's meeting to Friday that week. This will need to be
taken into consideration when booking rooms as well.</p>
<p>The design studio (CAE lab) may be a fallback if no rooms are available, but
it's not ideal to take over the whole room for one group meeting. You'll have
to check the lab schedule to make sure no other classes are using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meijo-university-visit">
<h3>Meijo University Visit<a class="headerlink" href="#meijo-university-visit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On one of the visit days, the Meijo students and faculty, some (~10) of the
EME185 students, the instructors, and some UCD professors will have a catered
lunch. Make sure to schedule a room for about 50 people that is suitable for
this. For catering, we have used Panera Bread in the past. You can go in to set
up an order and let them know that the Meijo professor will come in or call at
some point to provide payment information. Follow up a day or two before the
lunch to make sure payment info has been provided, or they won't start making
the order on the morning of.</p>
<p>Set up a campus tour for the Meijo students and faculty. Use the <a class="reference external" href="http://visit.ucdavis.edu/tourreg/groupTours/tourForm.cfm?gid=7">&quot;other&quot; large
group tour</a>
signup, and just make a comment explaining the nature of the tour. One of the
TAs or the instructor should chaperone them on the tour. The chaperone may want
to let the tour guide know that the students have variable English fluency, but
the guides tend to talk quickly anyway because they're following a script and
need to hit timing targets to refer to buildings at the correct time, etc.</p>
<p>Go to the EFL and ask Mike or Shawn about giving the Meijo students and faculty
a tour of the shop. Make sure it is not on a day scheduled for EME50.</p>
