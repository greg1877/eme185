<h3>General TA Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#general-ta-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Please log weekly hours in a spreadsheet in the Google Drive directory. This
information will be used to gauge if too much or too little work is being
given for the TA appointments. It will also be used to justify request for
more TA help for future courses.</li>
<li>The instructors and TAs will have a 1 hour weekly instructor meeting to go
over the upcoming week's activities. This should be arranged to fit
everyone's schedule in the first week of both EME 185A and 185B.</li>
<li>If you want to meet with me, check my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">work calendar</a> for an open weekday
slot and send me a request via email.</li>
<li>I strictly use the Linux operating system and strive to use open source tools
for most of my work. I prefer not to have to deal with any Microsoft Office
Suite file types. Please avoid these and choose LibreOffice for Google
equivalents so that we can easily collaborate and share.</li>

<div class="section" id="class-attendance">
<h2>Class Attendance<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id17">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="lectures">
<h3>Lectures<a class="headerlink" href="#lectures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In EME 185A, students attend one-hour lectures on topics related to product
development and project management. The instructor is responsible for creating
these lecture materials. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/schedule.html">schedule</a>
for information on the topics covered in lectures.</p>
<p>TAs are not required to attend any of the lecture periods, but they are welcome
to sit in on lectures or even give one or more. If you sit in on the lectures
I will ask you to note down feedback for me. If a TA would like to give
a lecture, just let the instructor know well beforehand and we will make
arrangements. Past TAs have given a lecture to introduce students to useful
things (e.g. 3D printing, microcontrollers) for their projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="studios">
<h3>Studios<a class="headerlink" href="#studios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In EME 185A, alongisde lectures, students will meet in their project groups for
a 3-hour <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/meetings.html">studio session</a>. TAs are required to
attend all of the studio sessions in the winter quarter. During these sessions,
TAs will meet with each of their assigned teams, go over their progress, and
help them succeed.</p>
<p>Teams vary significantly, so a <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/meetings.html#winter-quarter">185A meeting agenda</a> should be used early in
the quarter to encourage quieter teams to engage the TA in the activity and
their project.</p>
<p>One of the 25% TAs should create a meeting schedule for the studio sessions.
Each TA's meeting order should be randomized from week to week so that teams
will meet with their TA at various stages of the studio sessions throughout the
quarter. Effort should also be made to avoid overlap between the instructor and
the TA meeting with a team.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: talk about which portion of the studio sessions TAs should attend
(i.e. first two hours, last two hours, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spring-meetings">
<h3>Spring Meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#spring-meetings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In EME 185B, each team will meet weekly with their TA and the instructor for 50
minutes. These meetings should roughly follow the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/meetings.html#spring-quarter">185B meeting agenda</a>,
however teams operate differently and the issues that arise throughout the
quarter will change along with team progress (e.g. from design and analysis to
building to testing, etc.). It is worthwhile to establish this format for the
meetings early in the quarter and adjust to fit each team's style.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="office-hours">
<h2>Office Hours<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id18">¶</a></h2>
<p>Both the instructor and the TAs are expected to hold office hours each week.
These should be convenient for the homework due dates, and TA and instructor
office hours should not conflict. Past TAs have used Bainer 2071 or their own
lab for the office hours. Provide feedback to the instructor about how well
these are attended so that adjustments can be made if needed. You may want to
set up a <a class="reference external" href="https://youcanbook.me/">YouCanBook.me</a> page so that you know ahead of time whether or not
students are coming to your office hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="websites">
<h2>Websites<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id19">¶</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="canvas">
<h3>Canvas<a class="headerlink" href="#canvas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">Canvas</a> will be used for all of the private information related to the course
that is shared with the students, e.g. grades, copyrighted materials,
announcements, roster, email lists, solutions, etc. Request to be added to the
roster as an instructor.</p>
<p>Students should be directed to the Discussions section of the course Canvas
page to ask asynchronous questions electronically (instead of email). Any
question that could benefit more than one student should be asked here, so if
students email you directly, kindly direct them to Discussions. It is the
instructors' responsibility to answer these questions in a timely manner.
Consider enabling email notifications for discussion posts in your Canvas
account preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="google-drive">
<h3>Google Drive<a class="headerlink" href="#google-drive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will use a Google Drive for collaborative grading and sharing information
among the instructors. This should not be shared outside of the instructors as
it will have FERPA protected information. <strong>You must be extremely careful that
you do not share any document in this drive with any student.</strong></p>

<h2>Instructor Feedback<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id20">¶</a></h2>
<p>Course feedback, issues, and enhancements are tracked on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/eme185/issues">GitHub issues
page</a> for anything that we need to note for the future. <strong>This is publicly
veiwable so no private information should be shared here.</strong> These can be things
that need to fixed on the website, ideas for improving the course, things that
suck about the course, etc. Where appropriate, use the assignee and labels
features to help keep issues organized and easy to filter.</p>
<p>You're also encouraged to add to this guide to help improve the operation of
the course in the future.</p>
<p>At the end of each quarter, all instructors should meet to reflect on how the
course/quarter went. Notes from this meeting should be added to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/moorepants/eme185/issues">Github
issues page</a> to benefit future instantiations of the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading">
<h2>Grading<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id21">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Assignments should be graded and returned within 1 week of their due date.</li>
<li>For assignments not co-graded with the instructor (e.g. memos), the TAs
should calibrate by grading one submission together. For group-submitted
assignments, choose a team from one of the 25% TAs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="memos">
<h3>Memos<a class="headerlink" href="#memos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>TAs will be responsible for grading the memos alone. Each TA will only grade
the memos submitted by their own teams.</p>
<p>The purpose of the memos is two fold:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>to improve the student's ability to communicate clearly through professional
technical writing and pace out writing of content for the final report</li>
<li>to provide quality instructor feedback on their work and progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Each memo has a rubric that is available in Canvas's speed grading tool.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Grade relatively &quot;hard&quot; on memos so that the students take the feedback
seriously.</li>
<li>For each of the grading criteria in the rubric, start with the middle
category and adjust up or down. Students are accustomed to being penalized
for specific things, so be prepared to justify your decision and/or provide
detailed comments in the speed grader.</li>
<li>Calibrate with other graders.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reports">
<h3>Reports<a class="headerlink" href="#reports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Reports are co-graded. All instructors will set up a time to completely grade
a single report together, then portions of the rubric will be split for main
instructor grading or TA grading, and the reports can be graded our leisure.
Like with memos, TAs grade only for their own teams (aside from the fully
collaboratively graded report). We will either use Google Drive to
collaboratively annotate the PDFs or use the Canvas functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="presentations">
<h3>Presentations<a class="headerlink" href="#presentations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are several presentations that students will give throughout the course.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> list and briefly describe each presentation</p>
<p>All instructors will collaboratively grade all of the preliminary design
lightning talk. For all other presentations, TAs will only grade presentations
from their own teams.</p>
<p>Use the Google Drive rubrics for grading the presentations. When exporting the
completed rubric for the students, hide the scores from the instructors and
just show the average in the exported PDF (hide columns).</p>
<p><em>Note: There is a Google Sheets script `convertToPDF.gs` in the `bin` folder of
the website repository which loops over the separate sheets (one per team),
hides the individual instructor grade columns, and generates a PDF. It has some
issues with making too many requests too quickly, so you may need to run it
a few times with different loop indices (corresponding to the sheets) to
generate all of the PDFs successfully</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-showcase">
<h3>Design Showcase<a class="headerlink" href="#design-showcase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each TA will spend about 10 minutes with each of their teams during the design
showcase. While interacting with the team, a paper rubric tailored for &quot;live&quot;
grading will be filled out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="planning">
<h2>Planning<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id22">¶</a></h2>
<p>The lead TA will be responsible for several scheduling tasks. Details and tips
for each are given below.</p>
<div class="section" id="design-reviews">
<h3>Design Reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#design-reviews" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two rounds of design reviews: <strong>Preliminary Design Reviews</strong> and
<strong>Critical Design Reviews</strong>. Preliminary design reviews take place during week
8 of EME 185A, and critical design reviews take place during finals week of EME
185B. The design reviews are 50-minute sessions for teams to present their
selected concept (PDR) or final results (CDR) to the instructor and their TA.
The timing is as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>5 minutes of setup</li>
<li>25 minutes of presentation by the team</li>
<li>20 minutes of Q&amp;A</li>
<li>10 minutes for grading (instructor + TA only)</li>
</ul>
<p>This timing allows the reviews to be scheduled back-to-back in slots that fit
the class schedule (e.g. 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM, 2:10 PM - 3:00 PM, etc.). Getting
the schedule together is difficult logistically, but the following steps should
lead to minimal issues:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Check the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/schedule.html">schedule</a> for the dates</li>
<li>Get the instructor's availability.</li>
<li>Find out from the MAE office when small rooms (~10-person capacity) are
available.</li>
<li>Generate a spreadsheet with the common availability from the steps above.</li>
<li>Have the TAs fill in when they are available in blocks. Make sure that
blocks are overlapping to minimize issues.</li>
<li>Send a refined version out to students, instructing them to select only
a slot that their TA has available.</li>
<li>Fix any issues as necessary.</li>
<li>Get the schedule to the MAE office as soon as possible to reserve the rooms
at the selected times.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is recommended to get the room(s) booked as soon as possible. This
corresponds to sending out the form to the students right after the 12th day of
instruction (last day to add classes).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="b-scheduling">
<h3>185B Scheduling<a class="headerlink" href="#b-scheduling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For the second quarter of senior design, each team will meet weekly with their
TA and the instructor for 50 minutes. This requires a small room for about 10
people with an AV system and a whiteboard. In the past, the design studio
(Bainer 2071) has been used.</p>
<p>Scheduling for these weekly meetings is somewhat similar to scheduling the
design reviews, but it may be useful to ask for room availability in large
blocks so back-to-back meetings don't require the instructors to move around.
If you plan to use the design studio, get in touch with Jacob Kitada to check
when classes are scheduled to be there.</p>
<p>One extra concern for Spring quarter scheduling is Memorial Day. A solution is
to make it clear to students when they sign up for a meeting time that they
will have to move that week's meeting to Friday that week. This will need to be
taken into consideration when booking rooms as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meijo-university-visit">
<h3>Meijo University Visit<a class="headerlink" href="#meijo-university-visit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students from Meijo University in Japan will be concurrently designing and
building the same project as two UCD teams. They will visit and sit in on
design reviews as well as compete during the design showcase.</p>
<p>On one of the visit days, the Meijo students and faculty, some (~10) of the
EME 185 students, the instructors, and some UCD professors will have a catered
lunch. You can also invite EFL staff to the lunch. Make sure to schedule a room
for about 50 people that is suitable for this. For catering, we have used
Panera Bread in the past. You can go in to set up an order and let them know
that the Meijo professor will come in or call at some point to provide payment
information. Follow up a day or two before the lunch to make sure payment info
has been provided, or they won't start making the order on the morning of.</p>
<p>Set up a campus tour for the Meijo students and faculty. Use the <a class="reference external" href="http://visit.ucdavis.edu/tourreg/groupTours/tourForm.cfm?gid=7">&quot;other&quot; large
group tour</a>
signup, and just make a comment explaining the nature of the tour. One of the
TAs or the instructor can chaperone them on the tour, but Professor Abraha
should be ok assuming that role. The chaperone may want to let the tour guide
know that the students have variable English fluency, but the guides tend to
talk quickly anyway because they're following a script and need to hit timing
targets to refer to buildings at the correct time, etc. If the total number of
people going on the tour is less than 15, they might ask that you schedule
a private tour instead of the large group tour. This costs $39, so check with
Professor Abraha ahead of time.</p>
<p>Go to the EFL and ask Mike or Shawn about giving the Meijo students and faculty
a tour of the shop. Make sure it is not on a day scheduled for EME 50.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="external-presentation-options">
<h2>External Presentation Options<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id23">¶</a></h2>
<p>The students are required to present at the design showcase but there other
things to keep them aware of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BMES Research Symposisum (in May) for any biomed sponsored projects.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://urc.ucdavis.edu/conference/">Undergraduate Research Symposium</a> in

<div class="section" id="handling-parts-orders">
<h2>Handling Parts Orders<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id24">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some teams will order parts for their project through the department's
procedures. The <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/mae-purchasing-guidelines.html">purchasing</a> page lists
instructions for them to follow. Keeping track of and approving these purchase
requests is tedious, so some policies should be enforced to minimize issues.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Students generate a bill of materials for their report at the end of EME
185A. The TAs should extract the BoM from each report and put it in a folder
on Google Drive. When a request comes in, the instructor can quickly verify
that each item requested is in the most recently approved BoM.</li>
<li>It needs to be made clear to the teams that purchase requests containing
items not found in the BoM will not be approved. If they need to update the
BoM, they can email it to their TA, who will then review it and, if
satisfactory, replace the version on Google Drive. It should also be made
clear that students should not make their BoM a &quot;living document&quot; so that
this doesn't happen frequently.</li>
