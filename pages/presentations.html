<h2>Studio Meetings</h2>
<p>Each team will be assigned a teaching assistant. During the studio sections,
each team will meet with the teaching assistant for 15 minutes to discuss the
weekly progress and/or the current studio activity. Every other week, you will
additionally meet with the primary instructor for an additional 15 minutes.
You must prepare an agenda for these meetings and have it available during the
meeting. <strong>Your in-class grade will be affected if you don't have an agenda or
if you don't show up to these meetings, i.e. don't waste the instructors'
time.</strong></p>

<div class="section" id="critical-design-review">
<h2>Critical Design Review</h2>
<p>Critical Design Reviews will be held on Thursday and Friday February 25th and
26th, 2016.</p>
<p>Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical design review during the
eighth week of the winter quarter. The first 15 minutes will be for your
presentation. This will be followed by 10 minutes for the review questions and
discussion. The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify your
concept selection and design decisions through technical details and analysis.
We are not concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial concepts,
etc.) but what the final concept is and why you feel confident it will work.
The intent of critical design reviews is to insure that the proper methods are
being used in analyses and that the design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets
specifications, it can be manufactured, etc. Both your teaching assistant and
the primary instructor will be present along with other potential reviewers.
The presentation should be geared toward and &quot;engineering management&quot; audience.</p>
<p>Suggestions of what to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A technical description of the need you are trying to solve.</li>
<li>The primary specs and metrics your solution must meet.</li>
<li>A detailed technical description of your selected concept and solution.</li>
<li>Justification for your concept solution in terms of meeting the engineering
specifications.</li>
<li>Theoretical or experimental proof that your selected concept and preliminary
design is very likely to succeed.</li>
<li>Any relevant technical preliminary design details.</li>
<li>A schedule and financial plan to execute your design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Smartsite by
midnight Saturday, February 27th.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preliminary-design-presentation">
<h2>Preliminary Design Presentation</h2>
<p>During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.</p>
<p>The presentations will be 10 minutes comprised of an overview of the project
and selected design concept. There will 2 minutes for questions. This
presentation will be good practice for a high level presentation in industry
(for example, to high level executives). All students are required to attend
this session, and will provide a critique of each other groups' presentation.</p>
