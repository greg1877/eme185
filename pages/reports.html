    <h1 class="entry-title">Reports</h1>
    
    <p>Two reports will be due during the winter quarter:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Project Proposal</li>
<li>Preliminary Design</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that each report should be standalone. You may refer to earlier
reports, but each report should provide adequate information to allow a reader
to fully understand what is being presented and why. The reports should be
directed to other technical personnel that may not have detailed knowledge of
the project.</p>
<div class="section" id="report-format">
<h2>Report Format</h2>
<p>The reports will be due in PDF format via Smartsite by midnight of the due
dates posted in the <a class="reference external" href="http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/schedule.html">schedule</a>. A single
report should be submitted by one team member.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The report should fit on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets of paper[1]_.</li>
<li>All margins should be 1&quot;.</li>
<li>The font of main text should be 11 pt.</li>
<li>The font size in captions can be 10 pt.</li>
<li>Number and caption all figures and tables.</li>
<li>Include page numbers on every sheet.</li>
<li>Equations should be numbered and rendered as proper mathematical notation.</li>
<li>Any citation style is permitted.</li>
</ul>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id1" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label">[1]</td><td>Be sure to scale layout drawings correctly.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="section" id="title-page">
<h3>Title Page</h3>
<p>The title page should include the title, authors, team name, date, course
section, and an abstract (~150 words).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="table-of-contents">
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<p>The second page(s) of your report should include a table of contents, list of
figures, and list of tables showing a title and page number for all items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="content-sections">
<h3>Content Sections</h3>
<p>The main content of the proposal should not exceed 6 pages and the main content
of the preliminary design report should not exceed 10 pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references">
<h3>References</h3>
<p>All text and materials in the paper that were not created by your team must be
cited here. Be sure to up-hold copyright laws on any included material. Use any
citation style that you prefer that fully communicates the reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendices">
<h3>Appendices</h3>
<p>The appendices can be any length and contain details that don't belong in the
main text. This could include layout drawings, 3D renderings, detailed
calculations, big tables, source code, etc. Basically, anything that takes
attention away from the main points but provides the details that back them up
should go in the appendices. The content sections should stand on their own.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-proposal">
<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
<p>The project proposal should address the following things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A problem statement/definition along with your objective</li>
<li>Design specifications</li>
<li>Existing solutions</li>
<li>Design concepts</li>
<li>Planning and scheduling</li>
<li>Preliminary budget</li>
</ul>
<p>State and define your problem as clearly as you can. If your proposal deals
with the smaller component of a larger problem, discuss your problems
significance relative to the total system. List as many design specifications
as you can at this time including such aspects as capacities, speeds, size,
weight, cost, etc. as well as any other specific and/or general requirements
and specifications for your design. State your objective in terms of what you
expect to complete by the end of each quarter. Add other information that is
deemed necessary to &quot;sell&quot; your proposal. The instructors will evaluate your
report to determine the size and scope of your project, and if the objectives
are both well thought out and feasible. In addition, the proposal will be
shared with your project sponsor for feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preliminary-design">
<h2>Preliminary Design</h2>
<p>The Preliminary Design Report discusses the initial part of the design process
as related to your project. Specifically, the report will summarize the
information that you have collected or identify additional information
necessary to collect. It should list the alternative solutions that you have
conceived for the design solution to the project. This shall include sketches
of each alternative in addition to trade off analyses. Finally, you should
provide preliminary information on the design concept selected. Your report
should include preliminary calculations and additional sketches used in
arriving at your selection and feasibility test results if applicable. A
lengthy report is not desired. The primary purpose of this report is to
document the design concept selection and to ensure adequate progress.</p>
<p>The report will also include the Preliminary Machine Architecture, i.e., this
report is aimed at presenting the system concept architecture as well, which
will allow for the division of individual efforts. The system architecture will
be presented through preliminary layout drawings of the machine, discussion of
the various subsystems, and discussion of the interface between the various
subsystems. This report will ensure that work will progress smoothly into the
Spring Quarter.</p>
