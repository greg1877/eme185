    <h1 class="entry-title">Reports</h1>
    
    <p>Two reports will be due during the winter quarter:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Project Proposal</li>
<li>Preliminary Design</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that each report should be standalone. You may refer to earlier
reports, but each report should provide adequate information to allow a reader
to fully understand what is being presented and why. The reports should be
directed to other personnel that may not have detailed knowledge of the
project.</p>
<div class="section" id="report-format">
<h2>Report Format</h2>
<p>The reports will be due in PDF format via Smartsite by midnight of the due
dates posted in the <a class="reference external" href="http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/schedule.html">schedule</a>. A single
report should be submitted by one team member.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The report should fit on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets of paper[1]_.</li>
<li>All margins should be 1&quot;.</li>
<li>The font size of main text should be 11 or 12 pt.</li>
<li>The font size in captions can be as small as 10 pt.</li>
<li>Number and caption all figures and tables.</li>
<li>Include page numbers on every sheet.</li>
<li>Equations should be numbered and rendered as proper mathematical notation.</li>
<li>Any citation style is permitted.</li>
<li>The reports should be treated as a professional documents and formatted as
such.</li>
<li>The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
another engineering colleague or engineering management, and/or your project
sponsor.</li>
<li>All graphical communication means should be legible.</li>
</ul>

</table>
<div class="section" id="title-page">
<h3>Title Page</h3>
<p>The title page should include the title, authors, team name, project title,
date, course section, and an abstract (~150 words).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="table-of-contents">
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<p>The second page(s) of your report should include a table of contents, list of
figures, and list of tables showing a title and page number for all items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="content-sections">
<h3>Content Sections</h3>
<p>These sections should contain the essential text, figures, tables, etc. to tell
your story. This main content should stand on its own without having to delve
into the optional appendices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references">
<h3>References</h3>
<p>All text and materials in the paper that were not created by your team must be
cited here. Be sure to up-hold copyright laws on any included material. Use any
citation style that you prefer that fully communicates the reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendices">
<h3>Appendices</h3>
<p>The appendices can be any length and contain details that do not belong in the
content section(s). This could include large figures, sketches, layout
drawings, 3D renderings, detailed calculations, big tables, source code, etc.
Basically, anything that takes attention away from the main points but provides
the details that back them up should go in the appendices. Keep in mind that
the content sections should stand on their own. Additionally, feel free to link
to rich media: videos, websites, demos, etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="report-1-project-proposal-due-january-29th-2016">
<h2>Report #1: Project Proposal [Due: January 29th, 2016]</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the project proposal is for your team to clearly
articulate your understanding of the customer's needs and to share your
preliminary research findings, concepts, timeline, budget, and goals. This
story should convince your instructors and sponsors that you have a clear
understanding of the needs, have a realistic scope, and are ready to move
forward with concept selection, design, and analysis.</p>
<p>This document should be shared with your sponsor(s) for feedback in addition to
being turned into the instructors. Be sure to adjust the content to best fit
this combined audience.</p>
<p><strong>The main content sections of the report should not exceed 6 pages.</strong></p>
<p>The project proposal should address the following things:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Mission Statement</dt>
<dd>State and define your problem and objectives as clearly as you can. If your
proposal deals with the smaller component of a larger problem, discuss your
problems significance relative to the total system.</dd>
<dt>Identified customer needs</dt>
<dd>Use this section to show a more detailed view of the identified needs. It is
important that you sponsor see that you've understood their needs. Note that
you may also have discovered needs that your sponsor didn't explicitly
describe, so use this opportunity to share those with your sponsor.</dd>
<dt>Refined target specifications</dt>
<dd>List as many design specifications as you can at this time including such
aspects as capacities, speeds, size, weight, cost, etc. as well as any other
specific and/or general requirements and specifications for your design.</dd>
<dt>External concepts and existing solutions</dt>
<dd>It should be clear that you've &quot;done your homework&quot;, i.e. searched for
existing solutions and used them to help develop your specifications and
concepts.</dd>
<dt>Initial design concepts</dt>
<dd>You should have a large number of concepts to share at this point. Be sure
to show these off so that your sponsor can see that there are a wide range
of possible solutions to their needs.</dd>
<dt>Preliminary planning and scheduling</dt>
<dd>The preliminary plan should give at least a coarse idea of the important
milestones you will need to meet over the next several months to complete
your project. For example, you can state your objective in terms of what you
expect to complete by the end of each quarter, mid-quarter, or month.</dd>
<dt>Preliminary budget</dt>
<dd>The purpose of the preliminary budget statement is to give a very rough idea
of what expected project costs may be. This will vary based on your or your
sponsor's desire to construct a prototype or run testing. The instructors
and sponsors will use this number to start planning resource allocation. A
refined budget will be presented in the final report of the winter quarter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You may add other information that is deemed necessary to &quot;sell&quot; your proposal.
Use your memos as building blocks for the proposal. The instructors and
sponsors will evaluate your report to determine the size and scope of your
project and if the objectives are both well thought out and feasible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report-2-preliminary-design">
<h2>Report #2: Preliminary Design</h2>
<p>The Preliminary Design Report discusses the initial part of the design process
as related to your project. Specifically, the report will summarize the
information that you have collected or identify additional information
necessary to collect. It should list the alternative solutions that you have
conceived for the design solution to the project. This shall include sketches
of each alternative in addition to trade off analyses. Finally, you should
provide preliminary information on the design concept selected. Your report
should include preliminary calculations and additional sketches used in
arriving at your selection and feasibility test results if applicable. A
lengthy report is not desired. The primary purpose of this report is to
document the design concept selection and to ensure adequate progress.</p>
<p>The report will also include the Preliminary Machine Architecture, i.e., this
report is aimed at presenting the system concept architecture as well, which
will allow for the division of individual efforts. The system architecture will
be presented through preliminary layout drawings of the machine, discussion of
the various subsystems, and discussion of the interface between the various
subsystems. This report will ensure that work will progress smoothly into the
Spring Quarter.</p>
