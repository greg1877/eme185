<div class="section" id="title-page">
<h3>Title Page</h3>
<p>The title page should include the title, authors, team name, project title,
date, course section, and an abstract (~150 words).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="table-of-contents">
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<p>The next page(s) of your report should include a table of contents, list of
figures, and list of tables showing a title and page number for all items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="content-sections">
<h3>Content Sections</h3>
<p>These sections should contain the essential text, figures, tables, etc. to tell
your story. This main content should stand on its own without having to delve
into the optional appendices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references">
<h3>References</h3>
<p>All text and materials in the paper that were not created by your team must be
cited here. Be sure to up-hold copyright laws on any included material. Use any
citation style that you prefer that fully communicates the reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendices">
<h3>Appendices</h3>
<p>The appendices can be any length and contain details that do not belong in the
content section(s). This could include large figures, sketches, layout
drawings, 3D renderings, detailed calculations, big tables, source code, etc.
Basically, anything that takes attention away from the main points but provides
the details that back them up should go in the appendices. Keep in mind that
the content sections should stand on their own. Additionally, feel free to link
to rich media: videos, websites, demos, etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="report-1-project-proposal-due-january-29th-2016">
<h2>Report #1: Project Proposal [Due: January 29th, 2016]</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the project proposal is for your team to clearly
articulate your understanding of the customer's needs and to share your
preliminary research findings, concepts, timeline, budget, and goals. This
story should convince your instructors and sponsors that you have a clear
understanding of the needs, have a realistic scope, and are ready to move
forward with concept selection, design, and analysis.</p>
<p>This document should be shared with your sponsor(s) for feedback in addition to
being turned into the instructors. Be sure to adjust the content to best fit
this combined audience.</p>
<p><strong>The main content sections of the report should not exceed 6 pages.</strong></p>
<p>The project proposal should address the following things:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Mission Statement</dt>
<dd>State and define your problem and objectives as clearly as you can. If your
proposal deals with the smaller component of a larger problem, discuss your
problems significance relative to the total system.</dd>
<dt>Identified customer needs</dt>
<dd>Use this section to show a more detailed view of the identified needs. It is
important that you sponsor see that you've understood their needs. Note that
you may also have discovered needs that your sponsor didn't explicitly
describe, so use this opportunity to share those with your sponsor.</dd>
<dt>Refined target specifications</dt>
<dd>List as many design specifications as you can at this time including such
aspects as capacities, speeds, size, weight, cost, etc. as well as any other
specific and/or general requirements and specifications for your design.</dd>
<dt>External concepts and existing solutions</dt>
<dd>It should be clear that you've &quot;done your homework&quot;, i.e. searched for
existing solutions and used them to help develop your specifications and
concepts.</dd>
<dt>Initial design concepts</dt>
<dd>You should have a large number of concepts to share at this point. Be sure
to show these off so that your sponsor can see that there are a wide range
of possible solutions to their needs.</dd>
<dt>Preliminary planning and scheduling</dt>
<dd>The preliminary plan should give at least a coarse idea of the important
milestones you will need to meet over the next several months to complete
your project. For example, you can state your objective in terms of what you
expect to complete by the end of each quarter, mid-quarter, or month.</dd>
<dt>Preliminary budget</dt>
<dd>The purpose of the preliminary budget statement is to give a very rough idea
of what expected project costs may be. This will vary based on your or your
sponsor's desire to construct a prototype or run testing. The instructors
and sponsors will use this number to start planning resource allocation. A
refined budget will be presented in the final report of the winter quarter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You may add other information that is deemed necessary to &quot;sell&quot; your proposal.
Use your memos as building blocks for the proposal. The instructors and
sponsors will evaluate your report to determine the size and scope of your
project and if the objectives are both well thought out and feasible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report-2-preliminary-design">
<h2>Report #2: Preliminary Design</h2>
<p>The purpose of the preliminary design report is to present your selected
design, show that it is highly likely to work and that your goals will
realistically be able to be completed by the end of the spring quarter. This
document should provide sufficient technical information, engineering analyses,
and/or test results to give the instructors and your sponsors confidence the
presented solution will meet the sponsors' needs and all of your target specs.
Additionally, you will need to clearly state what you plan to accomplish by the
end of the course and how you will do that.</p>
<p>Note that your design does not yet have to be complete and polished but the
main concepts should be formally described in enough technical detail to make
your case. Furthermore, it is not a requirement to have a physical realization
of your solution for this class. You sponsors are aware of this. You can pass
the course with high marks by presenting a comprehensive design that is ready
to be built, i.e. enough information to pass onto other engineers and/or
fabricators. But we encourage you to develop simple prototypes as part of the
design process and a final prototype for your sponsor, as you are likely to
learn much more by doing so and be better prepared for the future.</p>
<p>The report should cover at least the following topics:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Introduction</dt>
<dd>You should introduce your problem in context with respect to your sponsors
work and their broader goals. The sponsor's needs should be clearly
explained along with the associated target specifications that you've
developed from the needs. Your mission statement should be clearly defined
with respect to these. The sub-problems you have to solve should be clearly
described and how they relate to the main problem. This can also include
comparisons of your solution to existing solutions and any relevant
literature that helps put your problem and solution into context.</dd>
<dt>Concept Description</dt>
<dd>Ideally, you are down to one concept or one plan of action (for
computational and physical experiments) that you are ready to move forward
with. You should fully describe your design to clearly explain how it
functions. The goal is to provide sufficient technical details to get across
the conceptual design. For example, how a mechanism will work or how all
your parts will fit together in the limited physical space. Be sure to make
heavy use of graphical means to communicate the design. The minimal
description should be based on the &quot;product architecture&quot; described in
Chapter 10 of the book and in class. The system architecture will be
presented through preliminary schematics and layout drawings of the design,
discussion of the various subsystems, and discussion of the interface
between the various subsystems. But you are welcome to present more details
of your design if you are further along.</dd>
<dt>Concept Justification</dt>
<dd>Your selected design should have sufficient justification to prove that it
is very likely to work. You can prove this in a number of ways, e.g.
engineering analysis, experimental testing, or through simple prototyping.
You are not required to have highly detailed precise analysis and testing.
Simple analytical models and tests are sufficient to prove that concepts
will likely work. You will be able to refine these during the second quarter
to further justify your work. You can also describe your decisions to
abandon other design concepts. This helps build your case that your design
is the right choice.</dd>
<dt>Plan</dt>
<dd>You should include a very refined project plan that breaks the remainder of
the project timeline into a set of dependent tasks and milestones. Every
task should have a duration, due date, its dependencies, and an assignee(s).
You can present this information in any way that you would like. The
graphical methods presented in the book and in class are good options for
this.</dd>
<dt>Financing</dt>
<dd>The costs should be refined as much as possible to give a very realistic
estimate of what you plan to spend. A bill of materials should be included
with best estimates of all project costs. Be sure to account for shipping,
tax, and any other indirect costs. If your sponsor is not covering the costs
(or all of the costs) of your project you will need to include a statement
that requests money from the MAE department. You must include the amount of
money from any other sources with this request. We will evaluate the
requests and try to provide you with your requested amount from the limited
available money by the start of the Spring quarter. There is no guarantee
that you will get what you ask for. This will be based off the amount
requested and the quality of your work.</dd>
<dt>Appendices</dt>
<dd>The appendices should include any details that support the content of your
paper. It should include sufficient details that document your work this
quarter. This should be highly organized and easy to follow. At this point
you can include details of your concept generation and selection process,
your full set of needs and specs, CAD renderings, sketches, diagrams,
abandoned designs, in-depth tasks lists and charts, extensive bill of
materials, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This report should be self contained. Imagine if someone that has never seen
your work picks up your report and wants to understand it in depth without you
present. Your report should include sufficient information for them to
understand your design and justification.</p>
<p><strong>Note that the main content of the report should not exceed 10 pages.</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to utilize your memos, proposal, and critical design review as a basis
for your report. Use the feedback from them all to improve the work for this
final written presentation of your preliminary design.</p>
