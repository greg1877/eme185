<h2>The Circuit Components<a class="headerlink" href="#the-circuit-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The circuit requires:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an LED</li>
<li>a photocell (photoresistor, light-dependent resistor)</li>
<li>4-8 jumper wires</li>
<li>a 4.7kΩ resistor (yellow, purple, red, [gold])</li>
<li>a 330Ω resistor (orange, orange, brown, [gold])</li>
</ul>
<p>Once constructed, the circuit should look like the image below:</p>
<p><img alt="complete-circuit" src="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/microcontroller-tutorial/complete-circuit.jpg" style="width: 5in;" /></p>
<p>The circuit consists of a light emitting diode (LED) circuit, driven by one of
the Arduino's digital I/O pins capable of producing a pulsewidth modulation
(PWM) signal. This will allow the LED’s brightness to change. A photocell
facing the LED senses the ambient lighting. The objective of the circuit is to
demonstrate an automatic feedback control system that drives the LED to
a desired brightness level near the sensor. You will be able to cast shadows on
the photocell and watch as the LED brightness increases to compensate for the
dimmed lighting.</p>

<h3>Basic circuit modules<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-circuit-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Analog circuits are circuits dealing with signals free to vary from zero to
full power supply voltage. This stands in contrast to digital circuits, which
almost exclusively employ “all or nothing” signals: voltages restricted to
values of zero and full supply voltage, with no valid state in between those
extreme limits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="light-emitting-diodes-led">
<h3>Light Emitting Diodes (LED)<a class="headerlink" href="#light-emitting-diodes-led" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are semiconductor devices that emit light
when voltage is applied across them. LEDs typically have a fixed voltage
drop of around 2V (depends on the LED), which is the voltage required to cause
it to illuminate. The brightness can then be controlled directly by varying the
current going through the device. In most applications (e.g. indicators),
a current-limiting resistor is connected in series with the LED to provide
a fixed brightness for a given control voltage.</p>
<p><img alt="led" src="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/microcontroller-tutorial/led.jpg" style="width: 3in;" /></p>
<p><object data="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/microcontroller-tutorial/led-diagram.svg" style="width: 3in;" type="image/svg+xml">led-diagram</object></p>
<p>In our application, we will use a fixed current-limiting resistor of 330Ω and
a 5V control voltage, but we will use a technique called pulsewidth modulation
(PWM) to effectively vary the current passing through the circuit.</p>
<p>PWM works by rapidly toggling a digital output between its high (e.g. 5V) and
low (e.g. 0V) values, with varying durations of on and off time. The ratio of
the on time to the total period of the PWM signal is referred to as duty cycle,
and is expressed as a percentage. The logic behind this is: if you were to
integrate the voltage over one period of the PWM signal, the effective voltage
would be the duty cycle times the &quot;on&quot; voltage level. If the switching is fast
enough, many sensors (including our own eyes) will not be able to detect that
the actuator (e.g. an LED) is actually turning on and off, but instead it will
detect an intermediate output roughly corresponding to the equivalent
voltage level. For mechanical systems, such as DC motors, the mechanical
dynamics are often slow enough with respect to the PWM signal that their output
will actually smoothly vary.</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno allows us to output a PWM signal on several of its pins. This
is done by setting the pin as an output, and using the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite">analogWrite</a> function. This function
accepts any integer value between 0 (pin fully off, 0% duty cycle) and 255 (pin
fully on, 100% duty cycle).</p>

<div class="section" id="photocells">
<h3>Photocells<a class="headerlink" href="#photocells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Photocells are passive circuit elements which change their resistance in
response to a change in brightness. Their resistance <em>decreases</em> when the
ambient environment becomes <em>brighter</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="photocell" src="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/microcontroller-tutorial/photocell.jpg" style="width: 3in;" /></p>
<p>An Arduino can sense voltages from 0V to 5V through the analog input pins, but
it has no direct way of sensing resistance. Since our sensor operates by
changing resistance, we need to convert this to a change in voltage. This is
achieved through a voltage divider circuit.</p>
<p><object data="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/microcontroller-tutorial/photocell-circuit.svg" style="width: 3in;" type="image/svg+xml">photocell-circuit</object></p>
<p>In this circuit, we supply 5V from the Arduino as <span class="math">\(V_{\text{in}}\)</span> and
measure <span class="math">\(V_{\text{out}}\)</span> with one of the Arduino's analog input pins (pin
A0). The output voltage for this voltage divider is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{out}} = \frac{R}{R + \ R_{s}}V_{\text{in}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We know <span class="math">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math">\(V_{\text{in}}\)</span>, and we can measure
<span class="math">\(V_{\text{out}}\)</span>, so we can calculate the photocell resistance
<span class="math">\(R_{s}\)</span>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Photonic%20Detetectors%20Inc%20PDFs/PDV-P7002.pdf">datasheet</a>
for our photocell provides an approximate relationship between resistance and
the illuminance hitting the sensor:</p>
<p><img alt="photocell-resistance" src="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/microcontroller-tutorial/photocell-resistance.png" style="width: 4in;" /></p>
<p>In our example, however, we will simply convert the value read in by
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogRead">analogRead</a> to a voltage.
The input comes in the form of a <strong>10-bit unsigned integer</strong>, so it has the
range of 0 to 1023 (<span class="math">\(2^{10} - 1 = 1023\)</span>), corresponding to 0V up to 5V,
respectively. If we read a value of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, we can map this value to
a voltage as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
V = \frac{5}{1023}x

<h2>Control System<a class="headerlink" href="#control-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now we'll put the LED and photocell together in order to obtain a desired
brightness level. Here is a block diagram of the control system we will
implement to achieve this:</p>
<p><object data="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/images/microcontroller-tutorial/controller.svg" style="width: 7in;" type="image/svg+xml">controller</object></p>
<p>In this controller example, we will use voltage as a representation of
brightness. Because of the voltage divider configuration, the voltage read by
the Arduino's input pin will vary proportionally to the brightness sensed by
the photocell.</p>
<p>The measured voltage is compared to a voltage representing the desired
brightness, resulting in some error. This error is then fed into a controller,
which transforms the error into a PWM signal to change the LED brightness. For
example, if the measured brightness is lower than desired, the error will be
positive, and the controller coefficients will produce a positive PWM signal to
drive the LED to become brighter. This has the effect of increasing the
measured voltage, hence decreasing the error. This kind of controller
configuration is called a regulator, and its job is to achieve and maintain
zero error between the measured output and the desired output.</p>

<h3>Circuit Construction<a class="headerlink" href="#circuit-construction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Below is a diagram of the complete circuit and the photo from before. Both
components (the LED and the photocell) should be connected from the previous
two sections. The most important part of the control circuit construction
(aside from making the correct electrical connections) is that the LED and
photocell are close to and facing one another. This will ensure that the LED is
able to influence the reading of the sensor as much as possible. The photo of
the completed circuit is repeated below:</p>

<p>As you probably have noticed, proportional controllers may suffer from non-zero
<em>steady state error</em>. That is, there is a consistent mismatch between the
desired and measured outputs, but the controller does not compensate for it
exactly. To fix this problem, we can implement an integral control component,
which adds to the controller output a multiple of the total integral of the
error over all time. If a small but steady error is present, the integral of
this error over time will become large, and the integral component of the
controller will increase the total controller output to drive the error down to
zero.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Starting with the code you wrote to implement the proportional controller,
introduce a global variable <span class="math">\(K_{i}\)</span> and set it to an order of
magnitude smaller than <span class="math">\(K_{p}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Introduce a variable to keep track of the total accumulation of error. Each
time the error is calculated, add it to the current value of the error
accumulator variable.</li>
<li>Modify the line that computes the PWM control value to use the full control
equation:</li>
</ol>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
u(t) = K_{p}e(t) + K_{i}\sum_{\tau=0}^{t}e(\tau)
\end{equation*}

<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Upload the sketch and open the serial plotter. <em>What happens if you cast
shadows on the circuit now?</em></li>
<li>Play around with <span class="math">\(K_p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K_i\)</span>. What does increasing or
decreasing these coefficients do? Compare your observations to some of the
information on Wikipedia's extensive article on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID control</a></li>
