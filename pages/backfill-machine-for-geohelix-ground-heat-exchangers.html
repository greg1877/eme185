    <h1 class="entry-title">Backfill Machine for GeoHelix Ground Heat Exchangers</h1>
    <h2><a href="http://www.icidualcool.com/">Integrated Comfort, Inc.</a>, Davis, CA, USA</h2>
    <p><strong>ID:</strong> backfill</p>
    <p><strong>Relevant Skills:</strong> mechanical design, heat transfer</p>
    
    <p>Integrated Comfort (ICI) is developing a new product line aimed at the growing
market for zero-net-energy, all-electric homes. While most new homes in
California are currently heated with natural gas or propane, the need to reduce
extraction of fossil fuels favors all-electric homes. Air-source heat pumps
offer a direct path to all-electric heating, but their efficiency is
compromised by the bias of heating loads to times when the air-source heat pump
is least efficient. Ground-source heat pumps are much more efficient, but
current ground heat exchangers are so expensive that it makes more sense to add
PV (where space avails) and live with low air-source efficiencies. The
GeoHelix is a ground heat exchanger that promises &quot;lower-than-PV&quot; costs and
facilitates net-zero performance with smaller PV arrays.</p>
<p>The GeoHelix uses a 22&quot; diameter, vertical helical polyethylene tubing
configuration placed in a  15' to 22' deep, 24&quot; diameter augered hole.  These
ground heat exchangers are packed tightly after factory fabrication, then
extended and held in their full vertical shape just before insertion in the
augered hole. The auger technology is well-developed for installing the
GeoHelix, but the backfill process is not. Many have been installed but
backfilling has not been optimized as to either materials or equipment.   It is
desirable to use &quot;cuttings&quot; from the auger excavation process, but compacting
re-inserted cuttings is problematic. Good thermal conductivity of the fill, and
compaction that  ensures full and permanent contact with the full tubing
surface area, are key to long-term GeoHelix performance.  Also, falling dirt
clumps can damage the tubing. Sand poured through a grate is currently the
preferred methodology, but the sand adds cost, requires cuttings to be removed,
and may not be the best option thermally.</p>
<p>ICI's current interest is in a &quot;backfill machine&quot; that can pulverize cuttings
and possibly add a liquid grout to pump into the hole, preferably through a
large fill tube or hose that discharges at the right depth level as the hole is
filled.  Integrating the backfill strategy with placement of the cuttings
during the augering would enhance the solution. Despite this &quot;current
interest,&quot; ICI would encourage the student team toward a holistic design
approach.</p>
