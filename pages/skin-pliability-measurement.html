<h2>Clinical Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#clinical-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Radiation treatment is commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in cancer
treatment. Radiation exposure leads to irreversible tissue damage in the
irradiated fields such as; loss of pliability and elasticity in the skin (Dorr
et al., Radiother Oncol. 61, 223-231, 2001). This condition represents a
significant clinical problem in case of post mastectomy breast reconstruction.
Implants are commonly used for breast reconstruction; however, prior to the
placement of permanent breast implants an adequate skin pocket has to be
prepared by the use of skin expanders. The expanders are placed under the
breast skin following mastectomy and inflated gradually via saline injections
over a period of time to expand the skin envelope. Expansion process becomes
challenging and complicated in case of prior radiation treatment. The most
common complications are the implant exposure, due to the loss of skin
pliability, and infection, due to poor vascularity of the irradiated skin
(Brennan et al., Breast. 30, 59-65, 2016 ). Subcutaneous fat injection to the
irradiated breast improves the skin quality and vascularity; therefore,
decreasing the expander related complications (Ribuffo et al., Aesthetic Plast
Surg. 37(6), 1146-52,2013).</p>
<p>However, there is no objective documentation of this effect in the literature.
Our aim in this proposal is to examine and quantify the effects of fat
injection on the pliability of the irradiated skin using a rat model.  We will
first irradiate the dorsal skin of the rats and inject the irradiated skin with
fat grafts harvested from inguinal fat pads of the animals. We will
quantitatively document the changes in the pliability of the skin.  There are
various devices to measure the skin pliability in clinics but there is no
device suitable for animal studies. Therefore, we are planning to develop a
custom made device to measure the skin pliability with the help of a student
from College of Engineering through the opportunity offered by UC Davis CTSC.</p>

<h2>Translational Importance<a class="headerlink" href="#translational-importance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Quantifying the changes in skin pliability may allow the surgeons to adjust the
amount and frequency of the expansion in a more standard fashion. This will
help to decrease the complications related with the expansion of the irradiated
skin and dramatically improve patient care.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="desired-outcomes">
<h2>Desired outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#desired-outcomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We are expecting to establish a numerical correlation between the skin
pliability and expansion amounts and frequency to standardize the expansion
process. We are also expecting that these numerical guidelines will prevent the
skin necrosis by proper adjustment of expansion amount and frequency.</p>
