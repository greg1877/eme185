:title: Meetings
:status: hidden

Each team will be assigned a teaching assistant that will act as a consultant
for your project. During the winter studio sections, each team will meet with
the teaching assistant for approximately 30 minutes each week to discuss the
weekly progress and/or the current studio activity. Additionally, your team
will meet with the main instructor for approximately 15 minutes. In the Spring
quarter, you will meet with the TA and the instructor together for 30+ minutes
per week.

To prepare for the meeting, you are required to send an update email to the
instructor, your assigned TA, your client, all of your teammates, and anyone
else that is directly involved in your project 24 hours before the beginning of
the meeting. The subject line of the email should be as follows:

``[EME185] AIO: <team name>``

where "<team name>" is replaced with your team's name.

"AIO" stands for Accomplishments, Issues, and Objectives. This email should
contain three bullet lists: (1) what your team accomplished in the previous
week, (2) what issues you encountered during that week and would like help
with, and finally (3) what your objectives are for the coming week. Both the
accomplishments and objectives sections should indicate who worked on (or will
work on) each item and how much time that person spent (or will spend) on that
item. Lastly, this document should include a snapshot of your Gantt Chart with
a vertical line indicating the date of the meeting and the percent complete of
each task in the chart.

**Your in-class grade will be affected if you don't send an AIO or if you don't
show up to these meetings.**
