:title: Reports
:status: hidden

Two reports will be due during the winter quarter:

1. Design Project Proposal, Specifications, and Objective Report
2. Preliminary Design Report including Preliminary Product Architecture

Please note that each report should be standalone. You certainly may refer to
earlier reports, but each report should provide adequate information to allow a
reader to fully understand what is being presented and why. The reports should
be directed to other technical personnel, but those without detailed knowledge
of the project.

Design Project Proposal, Specifications And Objective Report
============================================================

The Design Project Proposal, Specifications and Objective Report should contain
the following:

1. A problem statement or definition.
2. A list of preliminary design specifications.
3. An objective statement.

State and define your problem as clearly as you can. If your proposal deals
with the smaller component of a larger problem, discuss your problems
significance relative to the total system. List as many design specifications
as you can at this time including such aspects as capacities, speeds, size,
weight, cost, etc. as well as any other specific and/or general requirements
and specifications for your design. State your objective in terms of what you
expect to complete by the end of each quarter. Add other information that is
deemed necessary to "sell" your proposal. Your instructor will evaluate your
report to determine the size and scope of your project, and if the objectives
are both well thought out and feasible.

Preliminary Design Report
=========================

The Preliminary Design Report discusses the initial part of the design process
as related to your project. Specifically, the report will summarize the
information that you have collected or identify additional information
necessary to collect. It should list the alternative solutions that you have
conceived for the design solution to the project. This shall include sketches
of each alternative in addition to trade off analyses. Finally, you should
provide preliminary information on the design concept selected.  Your report
should include preliminary calculations and additional sketches used in
arriving at your selection and feasibility test results if applicable.  A
lengthy report is not desired. The primary purpose of this report is to
document the design concept selection and to ensure adequate progress. You
should additionally include a preliminary schedule of the project in a GANT
format.

The report will also include the Preliminary Machine Architecture, i.e., this
report is aimed at presenting the system concept architecture as well, which
will allow for the division of individual efforts. The system architecture
will be presented through preliminary layout drawings of the machine,
discussion of the various subsystems, and discussion of the interface between
the various subsystems. This report will ensure that work will progress
smoothly into the Spring Quarter.
