:title: Purchasing Tips
:status: hidden

These are some recommendations for finding items you might need for your
project. For instructions on how to make purchases, see the `MAE Purchasing
Guidelines <{filename}/pages/purchasing.rst>`_.


General Advice
--------------

- While purchasing parts online is convenient, it may be cost and time
  effective to browse locally first.
- 80/20 is not the only way to make a sturdy frame.
- Perform a realistic evaluation of the quality of materials required. You may
  or may not require high-speed tool steel, but you should know for sure before
  buying any.

- `McMaster-Carr`_ is a popular supplier with a great interface. They don't
  always offer the best prices, however, so consider looking for the parts you
  need locally or with another supplier.
- `Grainger`_ is another large supplier. They have several nearby warehouse
  locations, so parts can often be obtained relatively quickly.

Electrical
----------

In general, simple electronic parts like passives (resistors, capacitors),
discrete components (transistors), and even bare microcontrollers are
inexpensive compared to mechanical parts. Always consider ordering several
extras in case a part is compromised in some way. Components can be quickly
destroyed by accidentally reversing polarity while prototyping, applying heat
for too long during soldering, or through electrostatic discharge.

If purchasing online, pay attention to the minimum quantity offered for a part.
Cheap components like resistors are often packaged in bulk.

While not very common in ME senior design, you may want to produce a printed
circuit board for your project. There are two basic options for getting a board
printed:

- Your board is one among several others being fabricated on a single panel.
  This option is slow (~2 weeks) but very inexpensive. One good option based in
  the US is `OSH Park`_.
- The more typical fabrication house treats your project on its own. Since they
  don't have to wait for other orders to come in to fill a panel, this method
  is faster (days) but more expensive than the communal option. `Advanced
  Circuits`_ is one example. Check for student discounts.

- `Digi-Key`_ is a major electronics supplier. Their filtering interface is
  a bit complicated if you're not familiar with purchasing electronic
  components, but it is a powerful way to narrow down what you're looking for
  or even to discover what is available. Make sure to check the "In stock"
  check box.
- `Mouser`_ is another option similar to Digi-Key.
- `Sparkfun`_ is more hobbyist-oriented and produces kits and easy-to-use
  modules you won't find on Digi-Key. They provide schematics for everything
  and offer tutorials for many of their products.
- `Adafruit`_ is similar to Sparkfun with a somewhat different variety of
  products.
