:title: Technical resources and Tips
:status: hidden

In the course of making your project or product successful, you will have to draw on your team's combined knowledge, experience and talents as an engineer in training.
But a good engineer also does not waste time 'reinventing the wheel' from scratch. There is a wealth of knowledge and resources available in the form of books,articles and videos on the internet.
Here is a list of some of these resources: 

Design Calculations and References
