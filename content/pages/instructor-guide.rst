- Attend design reviews and presentations.
- Grading the memos and reports [3 hrs]
- Office hours [2 hrs]
- Instructor meeting [1 hr]
- Activity preparation [1 hr]

37.5% TA

General
=======

- Please log your weekly hours in a spreadsheet in the Google Drive directory.
  I use this information to gauge if I'm giving too much or too little work for
  the TA appointment. I also use it to justify request for more TA help for
  future courses.
- We will have a 1 hour weekly instructor meeting to go over the upcoming
  week's activities. Please arrange this to fit our schedules.
- If you want to meet with me, check my `work calendar`_ for an open weekday
  slot and send me a request via email.
- I strictly use the Linux operating system and strive to use open source tools
  for most of my work. I prefer not to have to deal with any Microsoft Office
  Suite file types. Please avoid these and choose LibreOffice for Google
  equivalents so that we can easily collaborate and share.

Lectures
========

You are not required to attend any of the lecture periods. You are welcome to
sit in on lectures or even give one or more yourself. If you sit in on the
lectures I will ask you to note down feedback for me. If you would like to give
a lecture, just let me know well beforehand and we will make arrangements. Past
TAs have given a lecture to introduce students to useful things (e.g. 3D
printing, microcontrollers) for their projects. I'm happy to give feedback on
your lectures too.

Studios
=======

You will be required to attend all of the studio sessions in the winter
quarter. During these sessions you will meet with your teams, go over their
progress, and help them succeed.

Office Hours
============

You will be expected to hold office hours each week. These should be convenient
for the homework due dates and not conflict with Jason's office hours. Past TAs
have used Bainer 2071 for the office hours. Provide feedback to Jason about how
well these are attended so that we can adjust if needed.

Websites
========

Course Website
--------------

All of the public information about the course should go on the `course
website`_.  The website source is at https://github.com/moorepants/eme185.
You'll need to make a Github account and share your user name with Jason to get
access to modify the website and permission to edit the Github issues. See the
README for instructions on editing and viewing the site locally.

.. _course website: http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/

Canvas
------

Canvas_ will be used for all of the private information related to the course
that is shared with the students, e.g. grades, copyrighted materials,
announcements, roster, email lists, solutions, etc. Request to be added to the
roster as an instructor.

Students should be directed to the Discussions section of the course Canvas
page to ask asynchronous questions electronically (instead of email). Any
question that could benefit more than one student should be asked here, so if
students email you directly, kindly direct them to Discussions. It is the
instructors' responsibility to answer these questions in a timely manner.
Consider enabling email notifications for discussion posts in your Canvas
account preferences.

.. _Canvas: http://canvas.ucdavis.edu

Google Drive
------------

We will use a Google Drive for collaborative grading and sharing information
among the instructors. This should not be shared outside of the instructors as
it will have FERPA protected information. **You must be extremely careful that
you do not share any document in this drive with any student.**

CATME
-----

We will use CATME_ to select project teams and collect peer evaluations. Please
request a CATME account well before class starts.

To get the percent busy of all students in class, choose data and then "choose
params" to see summary.

.. _CATME: http://info.catme.org/

Reports and Memos
=================

You will be responsible for grading the memos. The purpose of the memos is so
the students pace out the draft writing and that we provide feedback on the
material before it is put in the final report. Jason will provide grading
rubrics.

We will co-grade the reports. There is a grading rubric, each of us will take a
section of the report, and can grade it at our leisure. We will either use
Google Drive to collaboratively annotate the PDFs or use the Canvas
functionality.

Instructor Feedback
===================

I collect feedback on the Github issues page for anything that we need to note
for the future. **This is publicly veiwable so no private information should be
shared here.** These can be things that need to fixed on the website, ideas for
improving the course, things that suck about the course, etc.

.. _Github issues page: https://github.com/moorepants/eme185/issues

Grading
=======

- You will be expected to return the graded assignments within 1 week of them
  turning it in.
- Calibration

Memos
-----

The purpose of the memos is two fold:

- to improve the student's ability to communicate clearly through professional technical writing
- to provide quality instructor feedback on their work and progress

Each memo has a rubric that is available in Canvas's speed grading tool.

- Grade relatively "hard" on memos so that the students take the feedback
  seriously.
- When completely the rubric always start at the lowest category and work
  upwards through each so that you are consistent.
- Calibrate with other graders.

Planning
========

The lead TA will be responsible for several scheduling tasks.

Preliminary Design Reviews
--------------------------

Preliminary design reviews take place during week 8 of EME 185A. The design
reviews are 50-minute sessions for teams to present their selected concept to
the instructor and their TA. The timing is as follows:

- 5 minutes of setup
- 25 minutes of presentation by the team
- 20 minutes of Q&A
- 10 minutes for grading (instructor + TA only)

This timing allows the reviews to be scheduled back-to-back in slots that fit
the class schedule (e.g. 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM, 2:10 PM - 3:00 PM, etc.). Getting
the schedule together is difficult logistically, but the following steps should
lead to minimal issues:

#. Get the instructor's availability.
#. Find out from the MAE office when small rooms (~10-person capacity) are
   available.
#. Generate a spreadsheet with the common availability from the steps above.
#. Have the TAs fill in when they are available.
#. Send a refined version out to students, instructing them to select only
   a slot that their TA has available.
#. Get the schedule to the MAE office as soon as possible to reserve the rooms
   at the selected times.

185B Scheduling
---------------

For the second quarter of senior design, each team will meet weekly with their
TA and the instructor for 55 minutes. This requires a small room for about 10
people with an AV system and preferably a whiteboard.

Scheduling for these weekly meetings is somewhat similar to scheduling the
design reviews, but it may be useful to ask for room availability in large
blocks so back-to-back meetings don't require the instructors to move around.

One extra concern for Spring quarter scheduling is Memorial Day. One solution
is to make it clear to students when they sign up for a meeting time that they
will have to move that week's meeting to Friday that week. This will need to be
taken into consideration when booking rooms as well.

The design studio (CAE lab) may be a fallback if no rooms are available, but
it's not ideal to take over the whole room for one group meeting. You'll have
to check the lab schedule to make sure no other classes are using it.

Meijo University Visit
----------------------

On one of the visit days, the Meijo students and faculty, some (~10) of the
EME185 students, the instructors, and some UCD professors will have a catered
lunch. Make sure to schedule a room for about 50 people that is suitable for
this. For catering, we have used Panera Bread in the past. You can go in to set
up an order and let them know that the Meijo professor will come in or call at
some point to provide payment information. Follow up a day or two before the
lunch to make sure payment info has been provided, or they won't start making
the order on the morning of.

Set up a campus tour for the Meijo students and faculty. Use the `"other" large
group tour <http://visit.ucdavis.edu/tourreg/groupTours/tourForm.cfm?gid=7>`_
signup, and just make a comment explaining the nature of the tour. One of the
TAs or the instructor should chaperone them on the tour. The chaperone may want
to let the tour guide know that the students have variable English fluency, but
the guides tend to talk quickly anyway because they're following a script and
need to hit timing targets to refer to buildings at the correct time, etc.

Go to the EFL and ask Mike or Shawn about giving the Meijo students and faculty
a tour of the shop. Make sure it is not on a day scheduled for EME50.
