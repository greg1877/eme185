Preliminary Design Review
=========================

Preliminary Design Reviews will be held the week of February 27th.

Your team will be scheduled for a 50 minute preliminary design review during
the eighth week of the winter quarter. The first 5 minutes will be for setup
followed by your 25 minute presentation. This will be followed by 20 minutes
for the review questions and discussion. The primary purpose of this review is
for your team to justify your concept selection and design decisions through
technical details and analysis.  We are not concerned with the path to the
final design (i.e., initial concepts, etc.) but what the final concept is and
why you feel confident it will work.  The intent of critical design reviews is
to insure that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the
design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be
manufactured, etc. Both your teaching assistant and the primary instructor will
be present along with other potential reviewers.  The presentation should be
geared toward and "engineering management" audience.

Suggestions of what to include:

- A technical description of the need you are trying to solve.
- The primary specs and metrics your solution must meet.
- A detailed technical description of your selected concept and solution.
- Justification for your concept solution in terms of meeting the engineering
  specifications.
- Theoretical or experimental proof that your selected concept and preliminary
  design is very likely to succeed.
- Any relevant technical preliminary design details.
- A schedule and financial plan to execute your design.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
midnight Friday, March 3rd.**

Preliminary Design Presentation
===============================

During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.

The presentations will be 5 minutes comprised of an overview of the project and
selected design concept. There will 3 minutes for questions and changing
groups. This presentation will be good practice for a high level presentation
in industry (for example, to high level executives). All students are required
to attend this session.

Spring Quarter Studio Meetings
==============================

Each team will meet with the instructor and their teaching assistant for 45
minutes to discuss the weekly progress. You must prepare an agenda for these
meetings and have it available during the meeting. **Your in-class grade will
be affected if you don't have an agenda or if you don't show up to these
meetings, i.e. don't waste the instructors' time.**

Engineering Design Showcase Poster Presentation
===============================================

Your team will be required to present your work at the Engineering Design
Showcase at the ARC Pavilion on Thursday June 8th from 2-4 pm. You need to
`register for the showcase`_ by **TBA**. Each team will develop a poster that
showcases and explains your project which must be submitted to both Canvas and
to Alin Wakefield for printing by **12 PM TBA**. You are also welcome and
encouraged to bring any prototype that you have constructed or videos and other
media that will explain your project. Any special accommodations for your
prototype (size, power, etc) or presentation must be coordinated with Alin
Wakefield with the initial contact happening by **TBA**. At least one member of
the team must be present at the poster at all times from 2-4 pm and all team
members must attend the event. Your team's poster will be visited by one or
more industry judges who will score your poster. These scores will be taken
into account for your poster presentation grade.

Content Suggestions
-------------------

Keep in mind that the posters should be designed for a more general audience.
Most of the visitors to the showcase will either be students, faculty, staff,
or representatives from industry. So the poster should be understandable by
people that aren't necessarily mechanical engineers. Your poster should
address:

- A description of your project.
- The main need or needs and how you've addressed them.
- Why your project is a great solution.
- Any innovative things you've come up with.

You can get ideas for posters by checking out the previous posters in the
files section of Canvas or those that are hanging in Bainer Hall.

There are many websites offering tips on making posters. Here is a good one for
scientific posters, but most of the advice is also applicable to your poster
design:

Your poster should sell your ideas and yourselves. This is a great opportunity
to show your engineering prowess to the world!

Software
--------

Posters can be created with a variety of software packages, for example:

- Slide decks software (MS
  Powerpoint, LibreOffice Impress, Google Presentations, etc.)
- `Publishing software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing>`_ (MS
  Publisher, Scribus, Adobe InDesign)
- Word processors (MS Word, LaTeX, etc.)
- Graphics (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Photoshop, Gimp, etc.)

UCD Logos
---------

If you'd like to use UCD logos in your poster you can find information about
them at http://marketingtoolbox.ucdavis.edu/identity/logos/index.html.

Printing Instructions
---------------------

This describes details about formatting and submitting a poster. All team
members should read this message carefully and completely to ensure a timely
and quality product.

1. The Engineering Dean's Office will cover the cost of printing one landscape
   48" W x 36" H full-color poster per team. No other dimensions or sizes will
   be allowed. Only 1 poster per team will be printed (no reprints).
2. The poster file must be emailed to amwakefield@ucdavis.edu no later than
   noon (12:00 PM) on Wednesday, May 18th *and* submitted to Canvas
   assignments at the same time. Alin will not accept nor print any file
   received after this deadline.
3. Files must be submitted as a PDF (highest quality preferred).
4. When designing your poster, please carefully check the page setup settings.
   You must ensure your poster is correctly sized at 48" W x 36" H.
5. A PowerPoint poster template is available on our Canvas under the
   Files tab for optional use.
6. The CoE cannot be responsible for verifying the accuracy of technical
   content, so you are strongly advised to have your instructor review your
   poster prior to submission.
7. Once printed, the posters will be stored in 1050 Kemper Hall. Alin will
   arrange for setup and display of all posters in the Pavilion on June 2.
   Posters will be mounted to foam/poster board for stability and easier
   viewing.

Final Critical Design Review
============================

Critical Design Reviews will be held on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday June
12th, 13th, and 14th. Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical
design review during finals week of spring quarter. The first 5 minutes will be
to setup for the presentation while the reviewers grade. Then the next 15
minutes will be for your presentation. This will be followed by 10 minutes for
the review questions and discussion.

The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify that your design
solves your sponsors needs through technical details, analysis, and testing. We
are not necessarily concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial
concepts, etc.) but what the final design is and why you feel confident it
solves the sponsor's needs. Additionally, the intent of critical design review
is to insure that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the
design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be
manufactured, etc. The content should mirror the main content of the final
design report.

Your teaching assistant, the primary instructor, your sponsor, and other
potential guests will be present. The presentation should be geared toward and
"engineering management" audience.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
midnight Wednesday, June 14th.**
