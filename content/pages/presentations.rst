Preliminary Design Review
=========================

Preliminary Design Reviews will be held the week of February 27th.

Your team will be scheduled for a 50 minute preliminary design review during
the eighth week of the winter quarter. The first 5 minutes will be for setup
followed by your 25 minute presentation. This will be followed by 20 minutes
for the review questions and discussion. The primary purpose of this review is
for your team to justify your concept selection and design decisions through
technical details and analysis. We are not concerned with the path to the
final design (i.e., initial concepts, etc.) but what the final concept is and
why you feel confident it will work. The intent of critical design reviews is
to insure that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the
design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be
manufactured, etc. Both your teaching assistant and the primary instructor will
be present along with other potential reviewers. The presentation should be
geared toward and "engineering management" audience. Every team member should
have a significant speaking role.

Suggestions of what to include:

- A technical description of the need you are trying to solve.
- The primary specs and metrics your solution must meet.
- A detailed technical description of your selected concept and solution.
- Justification for your concept solution in terms of meeting the engineering
  specifications.
- Theoretical or experimental proof that your selected concept and preliminary
  design is very likely to succeed.
- Any relevant technical preliminary design details.
- A schedule and financial plan to execute your design.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
midnight Friday, March 3rd.**

Preliminary Design Lightning Talk
=================================

During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.

The presentations will be 5 minutes comprised of an overview of the project and
selected design concept. This will be followed by 5 minutes for questions and
changing groups. Only one team member will deliver the presentation, but all
team members must prepare to speak. The team member will be selected randomly
from the group at the time of presentation. This presentation will be good
practice for a high level presentation in industry (for example, to high level
executives). All students are required to attend this session.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
midnight Friday, March 17th.**

Engineering Design Showcase Poster Presentation
===============================================

Your team will be required to present your work at the Engineering Design
Showcase at the ARC Pavilion on Thursday June 8th from 2-4 pm. You need to
`register for the showcase`_ by {{ SHOWCASE_REG_DATE }}. Each team will develop
a poster that showcases and explains your project which must be submitted to
both Canvas and to Alin Wakefield for printing by {{ POSTER_DUE_DATE }}. You
are also welcome and encouraged to bring any prototype that you have
constructed or videos and other media that will explain your project. Any
special accommodations for your prototype (size, power, etc) or presentation
must be coordinated with Alin Wakefield at registration. At least one member of
the team must be present at the poster at all times from 2-4 pm and all team
members must attend the event. Your team's poster will be visited by one or
more industry judges who will score your poster. You should were business
atire. These scores will be taken into account for your poster presentation
grade.

Content Suggestions
-------------------

Keep in mind that the posters should be designed for a more general audience.
Most of the visitors to the showcase will either be students, faculty, staff,
or representatives from industry. So the poster should be understandable by
people that aren't necessarily mechanical engineers. Your poster should
address:

- A description of your project.
- The main need or needs and how you've addressed them.
- Why your project is a great solution.
- Any innovative things you've come up with.

You can get ideas for posters by checking out the previous posters in the files
section of Canvas or those that are hanging in Bainer Hall.

There are many websites offering tips on making posters. Here is a good one for
scientific posters, but most of the advice is also applicable to your poster
design:

Your poster should sell your ideas and yourselves. This is a great opportunity
to show your engineering prowess to the world!

Software
--------

Posters can be created with a variety of software packages, for example:

- Slide decks software (MS Powerpoint, LibreOffice Impress, Google
  Presentations, etc.)
- `Publishing software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing>`_ (MS
  Publisher, Scribus, Adobe InDesign)
- Word processors (MS Word, LaTeX, etc.)
- Graphics (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Photoshop, Gimp, etc.)

UCD Logos
---------

If you'd like to use UCD logos in your poster you can find information about
them at http://marketingtoolbox.ucdavis.edu/identity/logos/index.html.

Template
--------

Below is a link to a poster template for you to use as a basis for your poster.
Feel free to modify the colors, fonts, layout, etc. There is no obligation to
use the template.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DhddKWEk8GZJZDMotgJ7H-AxJdSh_fJkB5Cm2gQve-E

Instructions:

- **Google Slides**: open the link, then go to ``File -> Add to My Drive``.
  This will copy the template to your personal Google Drive account so you can
  collaboratively edit it with your team members via Google Slides.
- **PowerPoint**: open the link, then go to ``File -> Download as -> Microsoft
  PowerPoint (.pptx)``. Save the file where you want and you should then be
  able to open it with PowerPoint.
- **LibreOffice**: either use the above instructions for PowerPoint, or use
  ``File -> Download as -> ODP Document (.odp)``. A reasonably up-to-date
  version of LibreOffice should be able to open both file types.

If you have issues opening the file or if the template doesn't look right when
you open it, let your TA know.

Examples
--------

Here are a few example posters for inspiration. These examples are
research-oriented, but they may provide some ideas for structuring, laying out,
and designing your poster:

7. Once printed, the posters will be stored in 1050 Kemper Hall. Alin will
   arrange for setup and display of all posters in the Pavilion on June 2.
   Posters will be mounted to foam/poster board for stability and easier
   viewing.
8. If you do not want to keep your poster you should return it to the
   instructor and it will be displayed in Bainer Hall the following year.

Final Critical Design Review
============================

Critical Design Reviews will be held on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday June
12th, 13th, and 14th. Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical
design review during finals week of spring quarter. The first 5 minutes will be
to setup for the presentation while the reviewers grade. Then the next 15
minutes will be for your presentation. This will be followed by 10 minutes for
the review questions and discussion.

The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify that your design
solves your sponsors needs through technical details, analysis, and testing. We
are not necessarily concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial
concepts, etc.) but what the final design is and why you feel confident it
solves the sponsor's needs. Additionally, the intent of critical design review
is to insure that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the
design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be
manufactured, etc. The content should mirror the main content of the final
design report.

Your teaching assistant, the primary instructor, your sponsor, and other
potential guests will be present. The presentation should be geared toward and
"engineering management" audience.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
midnight Wednesday, June 14th.**
