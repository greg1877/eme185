Winter Quarter Studio Meetings
==============================

Each team will be assigned a teaching assistant. During the studio sections,
each team will meet with the teaching assistant for 15 minutes to discuss the
weekly progress and/or the current studio activity. Every other week, you will
additionally meet with the primary instructor for an additional 15 minutes.
You must prepare an agenda for these meetings and have it available during the
meeting. **Your in-class grade will be affected if you don't have an agenda or
if you don't show up to these meetings, i.e. don't waste the instructors'
time.**

Preliminary Critical Design Review
==================================

Critical Design Reviews will be held on Thursday and Friday February 25th and
26th, 2016.

Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical design review during the
eighth week of the winter quarter. The first 15 minutes will be for your
presentation. This will be followed by 10 minutes for the review questions and
discussion. The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify your
concept selection and design decisions through technical details and analysis.
We are not concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial concepts,
etc.) but what the final concept is and why you feel confident it will work.
The intent of critical design reviews is to insure that the proper methods are
being used in analyses and that the design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets
specifications, it can be manufactured, etc. Both your teaching assistant and
the primary instructor will be present along with other potential reviewers.
The presentation should be geared toward and "engineering management" audience.

Suggestions of what to include:

- A technical description of the need you are trying to solve.
- The primary specs and metrics your solution must meet.
- A detailed technical description of your selected concept and solution.
- Justification for your concept solution in terms of meeting the engineering
  specifications.
- Theoretical or experimental proof that your selected concept and preliminary
  design is very likely to succeed.
- Any relevant technical preliminary design details.
- A schedule and financial plan to execute your design.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Smartsite by
midnight Saturday, February 27th.**

Preliminary Design Presentation
===============================

During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.

The presentations will be 5 minutes comprised of an overview of the project and
selected design concept. There will 3 minutes for questions and changing
groups. This presentation will be good practice for a high level presentation
in industry (for example, to high level executives). All students are required
to attend this session.

Spring Quarter Studio Meetings
==============================

Each team will meet with the instructor and their teaching assistant for 20
minutes to discuss the weekly progress. You must prepare an agenda for these
meetings and have it available during the meeting. **Your in-class grade will
be affected if you don't have an agenda or if you don't show up to these
meetings, i.e. don't waste the instructors' time.**

Final Critical Design Review
============================

Critical Design Reviews will be held on Monday and Tuesday June 6th and 7th.

Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical design review during
finals week of spring quarter. The first 15 minutes will be for your
presentation. This will be followed by 10 minutes for the review questions and
discussion.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Smartsite by
midnight Tuesday, June 7th.**

More info TBA as the date approaches.

Engineering Design Showcase Poster Presentation
===============================================

Your team will be required to present your work at the Engineering Design
Showcase at the ARC Pavilion on Thursday June 2nd from 2-4 pm. You need to
`register for the showcase`_ by April 29nd. Each team will develop a poster
that showcases and explains your project which must be submitted to Smartsite
and Alin Wakefield (amwakefield@ucdavis.edu) for printing by the due date
Wednesday May 18th. You are also welcome and encouraged to bring any prototype
that you have constructed or videos and other media that will explain your
project. Any special accommodations for your prototype (size, power, etc) or
presentation must be coordinated with Alin Wakefield with the initial contact
happening by May 13th. At least one member of the team must be present at the
poster at all times from 2-4 pm and all team members must attend the event.
Sponsors and reviewers from many engineering companies will be present, so
prepare accordingly.

More info TBA as the date approaches.
