Studio Meetings
===============

Each team will be assigned a teaching assistant. During the studio sections,
each team will meet with the teaching assistant for 15 minutes to discuss the
weekly progress and/or the current studio activity. Every other week, you will
additionally meet with the primary instructor for an additional 15 minutes.
You must prepare an agenda for these meetings and have it available during the
meeting. **Your in-class grade will be affected if you don't have an agenda or
if you don't show up to these meetings, i.e. don't waste the instructors'
time.**

Critical Design Review
======================

Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical design review during the
ninth week of the winter quarter. The presentation is intended to provide
technical details and analysis of your that supports your design decisions. We
are not concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial concepts,
etc.). The intent of critical design reviews is to insure that the proper
methods were used in analyses and that the design is valid and valuable - i.e.,
it meets specifications, it can be manufactured, etc.

Preliminary Design Presentation
===============================

During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.

The presentations will be 10 minutes comprised of an overview of the project
and selected design concept. There will 2 minutes for questions. This
presentation will be good practice for a high level presentation in industry
(for example, to high level executives). All students are required to attend
this session, and will provide a critique of each other groups' presentation.
