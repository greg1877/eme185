Announcements
=============

- Reports are being graded. Hope to get them back this week but are taking
  longer that expected.
- Must sign up your team on the EME185B signup sheet.
- Request PTA number if needed.
- Please sign up for critical design reviews in the same way.
- There will be installation instructions sent out for the next lecture and the
  following week's studio. You will need to bring your prepared laptop to class
  and the following studio.
- Sandia awards: Societ of Manufacturing Eng and at the Design Showcase: 3d
  printing and national security
- Blum Center grants
- The remainder of the class is focused on developing your preliminary design.
  You should start selecting a concept, using engineering analysis and testing
  to do so, and refining your design to develop a basic product architecture.
  You will need to report on these things in the upcoming memos but can
  progress at your needed pace. You absolutely have to have a concept selected
  by the end of this quarter but the further along you are the better. For,
  example if you want to build something, ordering things takes time.
- Next memo: Prelim analysis
