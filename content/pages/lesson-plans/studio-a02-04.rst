Planning and Budgeting

Think about costs for some of your top concepts. Give a range and/or average if
you were to build anything.

Planning and scheduling will be talked about tomorrow in class. But this should
be a very high level picture of scheduling. You won't be able to refine your
schedule until you have a concept selected. But the framework should be there.
