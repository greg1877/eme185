Intro to microcontrollers
=========================

From wikipedia:

A microcontroller is a small computer (SoC) on a single integrated circuit
containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals.
Program memory in the form of Ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP ROM is also
often included on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM.
Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the
microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose
applications consisting of various discrete chips.

Examples:

- PLC
- PIC chips
- Arduino : Atmel AVR chips
- National Instruments

Arduino
=======

- 10 years old.
- Created for and co-by students.
- Atmel AVR microcontroller chip
- Digital I/O and Analog input pins
- Programmable with a C derived language (Processing)
- Open source and open hardware

================

- To test code that you want to run on an Arduino you must load it onto the
  board and see if it works.
- But you can emulate the board.
- Autodesk supported product to let you simulate your Arduino code before you
  run it.

Basics
======

- digital vs analog
