<Company/Team Name> Charter
===========================

Purpose
-------

State the reasons for the team's formation and the its purposes. Who are your
stakeholders, and what are their expectations of and for the team?

Goals
-----

What are the team's project, process, and quality goals? To what level of
performance are team members willing to commit?

Member Roles and Responsibilities
---------------------------------

While some team responsibilities are shared by all members, collaborative teams
work best when members also have unique roles and responsibilities. These could
be technical and/or project management-related (e.g. meeting facilitator,
documentation coordinator, information manager, point person for
sponsor/advisor communications, etc.). Create a table like the one below, with
a row for each member.

===============  ==============================
Team Member      Roles/Responsibilities
===============  ==============================
<member name>    <role>, <responsibility>, ...
...              ...
...              ...
...              ...
===============  ==============================

Ground Rules
------------

How and when will this team meet? What are the norms and ground rules the team
will agree to? How will you conduct discussions and make decisions? How will
you handle dissenting views among members? How will you hold each other
accountable for living by these rules and for task completion? What kind of
participation and level of commitment do you expect from one another?

Potential Barriers and Coping Strategies
----------------------------------------

What barriers to effective teamwork might potentially arise in the course of
completing your project and other team obligations, and how will you handle
them if they materialize? What problems with team dynamics have you experienced
in the past, and how will you handle them if they come up again?

Signees
-------

Have each member sign and date the charter to signify that the contents are
agreed upon by the whole team. Electronic signatures (typed) are fine.
