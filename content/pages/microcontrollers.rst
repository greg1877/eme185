:title: Microcontroller Tutorial Materials and Information
:status: hidden

Introduction
============

Microcontrollers_ are powerful tools that will allow you to bring your machines
to life. Relatively recently the cost of microcontrollers has dropped and the
accessibility increased such that hobbyists can make wide use of them. The wide
adoption is furthermore being fueled by a large community centered around open
hardware and open source code.

During the lecture and studio we will lead you through a tutorial that
introduces you to using a lightweight microcontroller called the Arduino_. This
first lesson will use an emulator for the hardware and we will cover the basics
about programming the microcontroller. The following week we will have an hour
long activity in the studio sessions where you will get to work with the real
hardware and will implement a simple control system in pairs of two people.

Preparation
===========

Please do all of the following before coming to class:

- Install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from the
  `software page`_ on the Arduino website.
- Make sure you have an up-to-date web browser.
- Sign up for a free circuits.io_ account.

Finally, bring your prepped laptop to both class periods [1]_.

.. [1] If you do not have a laptop with you, that is ok, we will be pairing you
       up with someone who does.

Objectives
==========

- To learn what a microcontroller is and what it may be used for in the context
  of mechanical engineering.
- To learn the basic programming constructs needed to program an Arduino.
- To get introduced to an emulation tool for microcontroller design.
- To understand how a simple theoretical control system can be implemented
  with a microcontroller.
- To learn how to control a high power motor with a low power control circuit.
- To practice building a physical control circuit.
