Objective
=========
Python (SciPy, NumPy, etc) or Matlab GUI or APP to facilitate calibrating
constitutive material models to experimental data.

Constraints/Goals
=================

focus on basic material models (linear, viscoelastic, plastic, hyperelastic)

Note
====

This could eventually lead into a possible internship position (undergraduate
or graduate)
