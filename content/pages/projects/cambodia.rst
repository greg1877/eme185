Wetlands Work is a social enterprise working to bring sanitation to the
challenging environments of Cambodia. Challenging areas include flood-prone
areas and the floating villages of southeast Asia's largest lake, the Tonle
Sap. Conventional technical solutions to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
are often inapplicable in such areas. Wetlands Work has developed the HandyPod
to treat sewage from floating schools and households, and is working on
numerous aspects of providing comprehensive WASH in the area. Nevertheless,
numerous challenges remain. While untreated drinking water is now rarely
consumed, untreated lake water (the same water that receives raw sewage from
households) is used for numerous other uses such as handwashing, cleaning
dishes, washing food such as vegetables and bathing. As households in floating
villages tend to be poor, a low cost solution is needed to treat the large
amount of water required for such uses. Providing sufficient head to use the
water is also needed, for instance, in the form of a simple and cheap pump. A
specific example would be to develop a simple handwashing station for a
floating school, that can supply water for up to 300 students attending the
school. The solution should contain technical, behavioral, and economic
components, i.e. does the solution work? Will people use it correctly and
consistently; is it easy to maintain? And is it affordable for the users?
Another challenge is constructing well-sealed concrete ring pits for toilets in
flood-prone areas to prevent contamination of water resources via leaching into
the high groundwater table. Cost in terms of materials and labor spent on
constructing and testing of such structures has been a hindrance to the
adoption of our designs. How can we make the systems more robust and
affordable? Wetlands Work is eager to work with UCD mechanical engineering
students to come up with solutions for these and other problems in WASH in
challenging environments. Please see our website http://wetlandswork.com and

Additional Notes
================

Students who choose this project will have a chance to apply for a `Poverty
Alleviation Through Action Grant`_ from the Blum Center at UC Davis and, if
awarded, would be able to travel to Cambodia to implement and test in the
Summer of 2017.

Note that the students will be required to meet with the client via video and
phone conferencing.
