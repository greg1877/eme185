Background
==========

Flying Cars have been the rainbow chased by many an inventor from as early as
the 1960s Aero Car. The Sky Commuter had over $6 million dollars invested, as
did the Moller Sky Car to name a few of the many contenders. All claimed a
Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) capability, but no VTOL capable Personal
Air Vehicle (PAV) has come into being as a commercial reality as of yet.

The time for a step change in personal transportation is getting closer, and
many parties from industries and academia are actively working to make this
happen. A recent whitepaper published by Uber [1]_ best demonstrates recent
interests and effort from industry. Handling qualities and criteria of VTOL
PAVâ€™s have been investigated [2]_ [3]_, and it is envisaged that such a vehicle
will demand no more skill to fly than that associated with driving a car today
[2]_.

The problem
===========

Unlike the automobile, VTOL PAV development is still at an infant stage, and a
robust and effective layout (or vehicle topology) is yet to be found. Today a
simple Google search will reveal many VTOL PAV concepts, with very different
vehicle topology. Existing concepts are usually built at smaller scales, and
scalability of these concepts becomes a concern. We would like to develop a
tool that can quickly help a designer choose the best vehicle topology from
ones available at hand, and identify key design parameters for the particular
vehicle application.

Desired Skills And Knowledge
============================

In general we are looking for self-motivated individuals who have an interested
in Personal Aerial Vehicles and a keen desire to learn. Desired skill and
knowledge include a basic understanding of dynamical system modeling and
controls, 3D CAD (such as Solidworks), as well as core programming skills. The
participants should be comfortable with coding and debugging.

Desired outcome
===============

The goal of this project is to create software tools to aid the selection of
vehicle topology and physical parameters for VTOL PAV designs. Successful
execution should result in a real-time simulation platform that includes a
basic user interface, joystick input, and a reconfigurable physical model from
CAD models, as shown in Figure 1 below.

   Project scheme

Ideally the simulation platform should be able to demonstrate in real-time, a
vertical take off and a constant cruise scenario of a given vehicle model. It
will involve a basic user interface such that vehicle parameter changes can be
easily implemented.
