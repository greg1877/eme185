Project Statement
=================

This project will be to design, manufacture, assemble, and test an automated
visual inspection machine for precision calibration pins.

Description
===========

The current process for cosmetic quality control of Micro-Vu calibration pins
is 100% performed by trained technicians. This produces undesirably subjective
results, is time consuming, requires physical handling, and is a very
repetitive task for employees.

Desired Solution
================

A product that meets the needs of this project should:

- Automate the quality control process.
- Eliminate subjectivity.
- Maintain Cosmetic Quality.
- Decrease human handling.
- Shorten cycle time.
- Run parts in batches of at least 20, ideally 50+.
- Sort failed and passed parts.
- Have a small footprint.

Budget
======

$7000-$10000 excluding the Vision System of choice.

We have a large manufacturing facility and will allow students to work on site
or remotely. Micro-Vu is a company focused on automation and we appreciate your
support in helping us achieve our goals.
