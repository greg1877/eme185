Motivation
==========

Adherence of pathogenic bacteria and biofilm formation to food contact surfaces
has become one of the major concerns over last two decades. Several hundreds of
nationwide scattered food outbreak cases over the years urge the need to
establish a safe food-processing environment to control bacterial retention on
surfaces. One of the major sources of cross-contamination is from the packaging
line, where foods are getting into contact with possibly contaminated surfaces
for a significant amount of time after harvesting and before delivered to
retailer. Generally, packaging lines run cleaning operations after certain
amount of processing time. Therefore, it is important to investigate on the
cleaning efficiency for existing cleaning cycle and to find the optimal
cleaning time for commercially available sanitizers to maximize bacterial
detachment from the surfaces.

Objective of the Project
========================

Under a vision of long-term research, Prof. Barbara Linke and her team are
planning to build a prototypic model for a system, where fruits get direct
contact with the surfaces or having higher chances of getting
cross-contamination from the surfaces. After doing preliminary research, they
have found 'dump tank' of packaging line fits the criteria. Dump tank is a
reservoir, where fruits get first contact for initial cleaning and
disinfecting, before it goes to main supply line. Industries use chlorinated
water in the dump tank for initial cleaning and disinfecting, where water is
running under a constant flow rate.

Requirement of the Project
==========================

1. Build a scaled-down prototypic model of 'dump tank' made of 304-grade
   stainless steel.
2. Mimic the 'real-time' set-up same as the packaging line (i.e. use same
   chlorinated water circulation, same flow velocity, and same material.)
3. Removable tank walls sample. [Information of the set-up will be given by the
   project supervisors]
4. Must have tight sealing.
5. Must have water circulation.
6. Should be desk-top sized (less than :math:`1 \times 1 \times 1 \textrm{m}^3`)
7. Must have water inlet and outlet.
