Students will build a Pod to house the Homeless. (Please see Art Through Pods
on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/artthroughpod/ ) Students will meet our
current pod owners and listen to what could be improved on the pod build as
well as meet the design requirements from one of the founders of the project.
They should have a complete ready to deliver pod by end of the project to
deliver to a homeless individual. The hope is to have a low cost manufactured,
pod that could last for 10 years with rough use. The unit needs to be easily
assembled by anyone using simple tools. Unit needs to be weather proof,
insulated, mobile and have the option to attach to a bike. Unit needs to be
covered in ART! Students will need to collaborate with the art department to
complete their project. Start to finish, from paper to prototype to finished
art pod. I look forward to working with your students!
