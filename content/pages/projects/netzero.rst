Project Objectives
==================

Using EnergyPlus (Design Builder and/or OpenStudio with Sketchup) to develop
and adapt a series of simulations to guide the programming of a controls
sequence for the equipment and HVAC systems in a zero net energy commercial
building.

.. _EnergyPlus: https://energyplus.net/

- Validate predictions of this model against measurements of energy use from
  the building.
- Investigate controls strategies to optimise performance of the mechanical
  systems in this building.
- Implement and test selected control strategies and data visualization tools
  in the building, using existing energy management and control systems
  platforms.

Project Abstract
================

In coordination with California's Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32), the
California Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan (CA-EESP) has established a number
of targets to transform the patterns of energy use in California buildings. In
particular, the CA-EESP plans to achieve Zero Net Energy (ZNE) for all
residential construction by 2020, then to require ZNE for all new commercial
buildings by 2030.

This capstone design project will explore the design and control of several
energy efficiency strategies for ZNE commercial buildings. The project will
focus on a light commercial building in Davis that incorporates passive design
elements such as high mass, bioclimatic solar heating, and natural ventilation
to reduce energy consumption compared to conventional heating and cooling
strategies. The team will utilize EnergyPlus to simulate the performance of
this building, and to develop optimal control strategies for the mechanical
systems, equipment, and automated windows.

The project will include theoretical elements as well as hands hands-on
elements. The major intent is to utilise simulations to guide system control
sequences, then to implement these controls in operation. Therefore, in
addition to theoretical simulation, the team will develop familiarity with
various electromechanical systems, data acquisition systems, controls hardware
and software platforms, and building energy systems.
