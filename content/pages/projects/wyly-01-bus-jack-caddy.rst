Design and build a rolling caddy to easily mount a `Stertil Koni JB160 Rolling
Jack <http://www.stertil-koni.nl/en/products/accessories/jacking-beams>`_ to a
flush-mount `Skylift
<http://www.stertil-koni.com/en/products/platform-lifts/skylift>`_. Lift
installation is scheduled to be finished by 2/2016 at Unitrans Maintenance
facility. Caddy will be used to store the jack when not in use. Should be
compact, simple to use,  easily removed or stowed out of the way after jack is
installed.
