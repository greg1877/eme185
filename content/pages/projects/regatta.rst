SMUD hosts an annual engineering competition among colleges and universities in
California called the "`California Solar Regatta`_". The teams are responsible
for developing a solar powered boat that has to compete in three different
events: slalom, sprint, and endurance. The competition is held at the Rancho
Seco Recreational Area on May 6th, 2017. The team assigned to this project will
work with the greater UCD Solar Regatta team and take on a sizeable chunk of
the design and development of this year's vehicle. Example projects may be:

- Optimal design of the propulsion system
- Optimal hull design
- Solar tracker design
- Structural design

Last year's UCD team placed 3rd in design at the 2016 race:
