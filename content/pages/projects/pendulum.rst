Humans are marvelous machines. They are able to perform simple tasks, e.g.,
walking and dancing, almost effortlessly, which havenâ€™t been reproduced by the
most advanced robots with far more superior sensors and motors than humans. In
order to develop robots that can potential to replace humans to perform dull,
dirty and dangerous jobs, e.g., operating in a radioactive terminated area or
caring for senior citizens, one of the most fundamental tasks they need to
perform is to balance themselves. Currently the engineers are still struggling
to solve this problem, e.g.,

The specific aim of the senior design project is to design a robot consisting
of a cart and a double pendulum to mimic a scenario in which a human need to
balance him/herself on a bus or a train. The robot has the classical double
pendulum configuration that you have probably seen in your dynamics or control
classes. But now sensors and actuators will be added to the joints so that we
can test different feedback control law to the robotic system thus gain more
insights into human balance.

Here is the list of additional information of the project:

- Dr. Jason Moore and Dr. Zhaodan Kong will be the faculty supervisors of the
  project. They will provide all the necessary parts and equipment. They will
  also be actively involved in the conceptual development and the
  implementation of the project.
- The same robotic system will be used in a summer class for high school
  students. So one of your goal for the project is to design an interface based
  on one of the popular software, e.g., Matlab/Simulink and LabView, so that a
  student is able to test his/her own control law on the system.
