A novel solution to long distance commutes is a combined bike+express bus
system. By providing folding bike storage onboard a tour bus, commuters can
ride to the express bus stop, load their bike, complete the intercity journey,
and disembark o complete their journey by bike. But given the dimensions of a
standard motor coach cargo hold, how many folded bikes can be efficiently
loaded and by what mechanism? This project will require students to measure the
UCD Med Center shuttle cargo hold and design a solution that can efficiently
stow the maximum number of folding bikes.
