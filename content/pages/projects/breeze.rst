The Probem or Need
==================

Generally: Reduction of energy used by air conditioning, reducing carbon
contributing to climate change and increasing human comfort

Specifically: Adapting the design of existing greenhouse autovents for use with
residential windows to take advantage of night flush cooling.

Background Information
======================

Night flush cooling is a strategy to reducing cooling load by taking advantage
of high daily temperature swings (hot days, cool nights). Windows are opened at
night, cooling the space and thermal mass inside a house, then closed during
the day. Many people do this naturally, opening windows in the evening when it
cools off. However, people forget to do this consistently, and also donâ€™t
always close the window in the morning before it heats up. A simple, mechanical
device could do this task better.

There is an existing device used to automatically open windows in greenhouses
when it gets hot. They depend on a state changing wax cylinder to open and
close. Other designs use a bimetallic strip. They have existed for years and
are relatively inexpensive. **The design challenge will be to 'reverse' the
operation of the device. Instead of opening a window when it gets hot inside,
it would need to open the window when it becomes cool outside (~68 deg F). And
close again when it passes that same temperature threshold.**

The design challenge is made more difficult given the several different window
types in common usage. Also problematic is the device not interfering with
window screens. However, I think the project would be a success if it worked
well with horizontal sash windows.

Desired outcomes and goals
==========================

Adaptation of the autovent device to be used for night flush cooling easily
with several common window types. Prototyping and testing of the device.

Design requirements
===================

Open window < 68 deg F, close window > 68 deg F, easy attachment to window,
functioning with window screen.
