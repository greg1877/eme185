Introduction
============

Maize is a food staple throughout much of Africa. Eaten as a dough-like
porridge, it is called mielie meal, pap, ugali, sadza, nshima, etc in different
regions and is made from maize that has been milled into fine flour and then
stirred into boiling water. Traditionally the maize was ground by hand but in
modern times the flour is generally produced by electric or diesel-powered
hammer mills. These mills can quickly process large amounts of maize at a
relatively low cost but still have their limitations in Africa's rural areas.

The project sponsor, `World Bicycle Relief
<http://www.worldbicyclerelief.org>`_, is a non-profit organization with a
for-profit social enterprise arm called Buffalo Bicycles. WBR and Buffalo
Bicycles place approximately 60,000 bicycles into the field each year primarily
in rural Africa. The goal of the organization is to demonstrate the
far-reaching impact of quality bicycles on human development in rural areas so
that both government and industry take an interest in supporting and promoting
bicycle usage in these regions.

Besides providing vital transportation in rural Africa, bicycles also have the
potential to be an interface that converts human energy into useful work. The
organization is interested in developing a series of bicycle-powered tools that
can produce a strong ROI for rural households. The current focus is on water
pumps and maize mills.

The Problem
===========

The design criteria for the mill are the following:

1. Utilize rotary motion ideally in the 150-250 RPM range with acceptability up
   to 450RPM. A gearbox can increase this to any speed but adds cost and
   complexity.
2. Operate at 50-100 watts (sustained) and up to 400 watts (if user decides to
   pedal extremely hard for a brief period).
3. Yield 1kg per minute of fine maize flour from kernels with ~12% moisture
   content (hardness is similar to popcorn).
4. Relatively efficient so as not to waste a personâ€™s energy.
5. Smooth, non-pulsating energy input so that the pedaling motion is not choppy.
6. Selling price that achieves a strong ROI for a small farmer (USD $50 - $150
   depending on performance).
7. Easy to transport and setup quickly since security necessitates that it must
   be brought inside daily.
8. Tolerance to poor user treatment such as running dry, being left out in the
   rain, impacts, dirt, periods of disuse, lack of maintenance, etc. The user
   group is low-income farmers with minimal experience with machinery.
9. The interface with the bicycle is a 50mm long bushing through the frame with
   10mm ID and 20mm OD:

The current prototypes of the mill operate at around 5000RPM. A fan, mounted on
the shaft with the hammer arm, creates a radial pressure gradient from the
center of the 30cm milling chamber to the outside edge. The mill outlet is
located on the face of the mill towards the outside edge of the chamber. The
intention is that the flour-sized particles of maize with higher surface area
to mass ratio will be deflected from their circular trajectory by air flowing
to the outlet while larger particles will remain in the mill. In practice, this
is not as effective as it needs to be and a study of sepatartion is needed.
Variables include, but are not limited to, milling chamber design, fan design,
inlet/outlet design and placement, the role of projections (bolt heads) in the
milling chamber, milling methodology, use of non-aerodynamic separation
(screens), and grits removal.

Additional project background can be found by reviewing the study_ conducted by
Amy Smith as well as this FAO article_ on small mills in Africa.

Results
=======

The final result of the project should be a series of recommendations on how
the current mill design should be adapted to achieve better flour separation.
This would likely include a written report, data, and CAD drawings. Successful
project outcomes would be manufactured in a small quantity for initial market
testing in Africa.

Collaboration
=============

The headquarters of World Bicycle Relief are located in Chicago. However, the
project lead, is based in Taichung, Taiwan. He very recently joined the WBR
Product Development Team in Taiwan but previously spent five years in Kenya as
WBR's Product Manager. He developed the WBR mill and pump prototypes in this
context and continues to work daily with the Africa-based product team.

The client can share CAD drawings of the current mill designs, data from
prototype operation, and technical experience from designing and fabricating
the series of prototypes. He would be available for any electronic
communications and could replicate design concepts in Taiwan in support of the
UC Davis team.

Additional Notes
================

Students who choose this project will have a chance to apply for a `Poverty
Alleviation Through Action Grant`_ from the Blum Center at UC Davis and, if
awarded, would be able to travel to Kenya to implement and test in the Summer
of 2017.

Note that the students will be required to meet with the client via video and
phone conferencing.
