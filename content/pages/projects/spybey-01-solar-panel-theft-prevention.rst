KickStart wants to promote the use of solar irrigation pumps for smallholder
farmers in Africa. Smallholder irrigation is the best single-input income
generator for small-scale farmers in areas of seasonal rain, due to their
ability to sell harvest at times of high crop prices. Though the post-purchase
profit, and the return-on-investment indicators are excellent, initial price is
relatively high - around $500. To facilitate easy rent-to-own (hire purchase)
payments, Kickstart is working with partners to combine the solar panel
operation with a pre-paid system, operated by payments through mobile phone
money systems. The challenge is to make the electronics secure on the back of
the panel, so that if the panels are stolen, it is impossible to bypass the
electronics and use the panels for other purposes such as charging batteries.
We think that if a hacked panel is useless it will inhibit theft and increase
the chances of the system being viable, enhancing dissemination of this useful
technology. The solution could be mechanical or electronic or a combination of
both.

Other Requirements
==================

The group will have to communicate via video conferencing and coordinate with
the timezone of Kenya. It would also be ideal if the students in this project
enroll in D-Lab_ for the Winter and Spring quarters.
