Background
==========

The forces that act on a paper airplane are the same as the ones that apply to
real airplanes. When you throw a paper airplane in the air, the push is the
thrust and the air moving over and under the wings provides an upward lift
force while the gravity pulls it down. The air pushing back slows the airplane,
creating a drag force. All of these forces (thrust, lift, drag and gravity)
affect how well a given paper airplane flies.

Objective
=========

The goal of this project is to develop a machine that can take a roll of paper
as an input, convert the paper into paper airplanes, and launch the airplanes.
This will require cutting, folding and launching mechanisms that work all
together automatically.

The machine will have limits on its size and cost but other than that the
students may create any solution. The machine will be judged on how many
airplanes can be generated over a period of time (launching rate), time of
flight, and energy required.

Cultural Exchange
=================

A team of Japanese engineering students at Meijo University is also working on
a design for this machine independently of the UC Davis team. The Japanese
students will bring their completed machine to the UC Davis Engineering Design
Showcase to compete with the UCD team. The teams will compete and they will
have to create a presentation for the opposing team that elaborates on how and
why they created their particular solution.
