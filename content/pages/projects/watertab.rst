The problem or need / Background information
============================================

Designing an airplane wing requires high-level skills in understanding and
modeling the behavior of airflow around the wing. Commonly, wind tunnels are
used to analyze the airflow around models, but wind tunnels are expensive and
maintenance-intense. As alternative, a water table presents a simple and
affordable experimental setup to demonstrate similar effects in water by
utilizing the hydraulic analogy.

A new course around airfoil and nozzle design, manufacturing and testing is
developed by Profs. Linke and Hafez and sponsored by the National Science
Foundation. A flat water table is available, but an inclined water table is
needed because of advantages in set-up and water height measurements.

Desired outcomes and goals
==========================

The project goal is to design and build a prototype for an inclined water
table.

Design requirements
===================

The requirements are as follows:

- Water table must have changeable inclination angle
- Water table must have option to fix existing models
- Water in upper tank must settle down before tests start
- Table should have option to dye water with ink
- Table should have a small footprint of less than :math:`1.5 \times 1 \textrm{m}^2`
- Water slide needs to be transparent
- Water height is variable from 5.0mm to 0.1mm (by outlet at upper tank)
- Water velocity is variable (by height in upper tank)
- Hydraulic jump measurable physically
- Hydraulic jump measurable with previously developed photographic measurement
