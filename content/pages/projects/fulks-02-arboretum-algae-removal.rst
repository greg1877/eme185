The Arboretum waterway is a warm, nutrient-laden water body with ample solar
exposure. The result of these conditions is plant and algae growth on the water
surface. While these conditions are natural responses to the environmental
system within the waterway, they can be found undesirable from an aesthetic
standpoint. We have plans in place to alter the waterway system, by introducing
water flow through the creation of a gradient (using weirs) which will create
positive surface flow and re-circulation. This project is several years away
from full completion and we would like to have a system in place to deal with
removal of undesirable surface water algae and aquatic plants in the interim.
Such a system should be portable, avoid wildlife impacts, and have a plan in
place to deal with disposal of surface materials (such as use by the
biodigester, if possible). Commercial products are available, but they tend to
be expensive, slow, or require constant attention and disposal of materials
in small quantity batches. This would not be cost effective for us.
Alternatively, design of equipment that modifies water surface movement to
prevent formation of such surface plants in the first place, could be
considered.
