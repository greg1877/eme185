With the simultaneous rise in world population and per capita consumption, the
production of food needs to expand substantially. Such a rise is accompanied by
a declining and aging labor force in the developed countries. In the past few
decades, robots and computerized algorithms have dramatically changed the
nature of work in a number of domains, e.g., automobile manufacturing. These
emerging technologies have the capability of replacing humans to perform dull,
dirty and dangerous tasks so that humans can focus on tasks that involve
innovative thinking, flexibility, creativity and social skills. The long term
goal of the project is to develop a robotic system to detect and mitigate
destructive agricultural processes, such as drought and pest infestations, with
minimal or no human supervision.

The specific aim of the senior design project is to design the actor part of
the system. Once pest infestation has been detected by drone-based mobile
sensors, a drone-based robotic bug delivery system will be deployed to spray a
certain type of bugs that can consume the pests or parasites.

Here is the list of the specifications of the project:

- The drone/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) design is not part of the project. A
  UAV platform, either a quadcopter or an octocopter, will be provided to you.
  However, based on the design of your system, e.g., the weight and the power
  needed, you need to select the appropriate platform.

   Figure 1 The bugs, Phytoseiulus persimilis to be specific, are contained in
   bottles as shown in (a). Currently they are sprayed manually using a device
   as shown in (b).

- The bugs will be contained in bottles as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Currently, they
  are sprayed manually using a device shown in Fig. 1 (b). The method is quite
  labor intensive. However, you may want to use the device as an inspiration
  for your own design. More information of the device can be found here:

- The system should work in two different ways: pre-programmed and tele-operated.

  - For the first case, before each flight, parameter such as the spraying rate
    and the time to spray, are set a priori.
  - For the second case, a human operator should be able to remotely change the
    settings of the parameters and turn the system on/off.

- The project is highly interdisciplinary. You will work closely with Dr. Christian
  Nansen from the Department of Entomology and Nematology, Koppert Biological
  Systems (https://www.koppert.com/), and Dr. Zhaodan Kong from the Department
  of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.

Responsibility of the Faculty Supervisors, Dr. Zhaodan Kong and Dr. Christian
Nansen. They will provide all the necessary parts and equipment. They will also
be actively involved in the conceptual development and the implementation of
the project.
