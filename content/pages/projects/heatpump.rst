Grundfos provided the campus with a prototype water-source heat pump system
that they had been testing and now needs a home. With 1 kW of electricity input
the equipment can simultaneously provide 4.25 kW of heating and 3.25 kW of
cooling for the campus. A system design is needed for installing the equipment
in a location where it can connect to the campus district heating and cooling
systems, or otherwise serve simultaneous heating and cooling loads, likely at
the campus' Central Heating and Cooling Plant. With the proper skillset, the
student team can install the equipment as well, using campus skilled labor as
needed. This would also serve as a prototype for the campuswide heat recovery
project and district energy upgrade that is in planning phase.
