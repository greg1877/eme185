Lecture and Activity Materials
==============================

  "Files" tab of Canvas.
- `Microcontroller Materials and Information <{filename}/pages/microcontrollers.rst>`_

You may need to purchase parts and materials for your project with funds that
are provided by (or by proxy through) the MAE department. Please review the
`MAE Purchasing Guidelines`_ to learn how to do this.

Project Storage
===============

We have a small space that is available for temporary storage of your project
while you are working on it during the spring quarter. You can get access to
this room, Bainer 1071A, by asking your TA for the keypad entry code. The
following list shows the rules for the use of the space. Any abuse of these
will cause all teams to lose access to the space.

- You should only request the key if you actually need storage space.
- Do not share the keypad entry key code. If you do, then you jeopardize the
  security people's projects.
- Do not work or hangout in the space. It is only for storage.
- Group your items into as few boxes as possible.
- Label all boxes and any freestanding items with a contact name and phone
  number.
- Keep the space tidy. In particular, there should be no tripping hazards in
  the center walkway.
- No chemicals, paint, glue, or any things that require SDS.
- All items must be removed from the room by Friday, June 10th or you risk an
  incomplete grade.
- The keypad entry code will be changed at the end of quarter.

College of Engineering Design Showcase
======================================

At the end of the course you will be expected to present your results to

Out-of-the-box Resume Websites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people try to standout and skip the single white sheet of paper. Here are
some examples of doing something unique and different. This is easier for
software engineers, but there are likely clever ways to showcase your
mechanical engineering prowess that isn't tied to a sheet of paper.
