:title: Technical Resources and Tips
:status: hidden

In the course of making your project or product successful, you will have to
draw on your team's combined knowledge, experience and talents as an engineer.
But a good engineer also does not waste time 'reinventing the wheel' from
scratch. There is a wealth of knowledge and resources available in the form of
books,articles and videos on the internet and the UCDavis' Physical Sciences and Engineering Library.  Here is a list of some of these
resources that you may want to use:

UCDavis Library Resources
---------------------------------
The `Physical Sciences and Engineering (PSE) Library webpage`_ provides you access to a vast collection of resources that may not be readily available on the internet ranging from full Books, eBooks, Journals, Databooks, Patents and Industry Standards. Many of these are available in digital form. Some may require you to use the Library VPN to sign in. We encourage you to make use of these university resources in your projects. Remember to cite your references in your reports. The above webpage also contains a citation guide.
