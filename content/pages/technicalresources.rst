:title: Technical Resources and Tips
:status: hidden

In the course of making your project or product successful, you will have to
draw on your team's combined knowledge, experience and talents as an engineer.
But a good engineer also does not waste time 'reinventing the wheel' from
scratch. There is a wealth of knowledge and resources available in the form of
books,articles and videos on the internet.  Here is a list of some of these
resources that you may want to use:
