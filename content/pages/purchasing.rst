See above OPS link. Team or Purchasing Lead: Contact one of the MAE staff to
register as OPS user and obtain a brief OPS user training. Provide your
Kerberos ID and phone number (cell phone preferably) for OPS user registration
to MAE staff.

etc.

Order for Supplies and Consumables using a Department Purchase Order (DPO)
==========================================================================

Applicable to Store Pickup, FAX/Internet Order, Credit Card Order

- Obtain approval and correct account # for the order from the instructor.
  Your requested purchases must match your pre-approved bill of materials.
- Submit a complete OPS order via http://ops.engineering.ucdavis.edu.
  Order will e-route to the instructor and the MAE staff for approvals.
- Include in the OPS order: # of items, unit price, item/catalog #. Attach a
  price quotation or screen shot of product information if needed.
- If you have a large list of items from an online vendor, save the order in
  CART with your exact items in it and provide a copy to OPS as an attachment.
- Include shipping/handling charges when you calculate the total order for
  budgeting purposes. Charges may vary depending on delivery method (regular
  ground vs. overnight). RUSH order will incur extra shipping costs. For RUSH
  shipment, obtain approval from your instructor.
- Verify with the vendor that item is in stock and available for shipment
  within the timeframe needed.
- Submit packing slips as soon as possible to process payment of invoices.
- Plan ahead to avoid unnecessary high shipping charges.

Local Purchases
===============

To place an order at a local store for pickup, these are the procedures to
follow:

1. Go to local store and record quantity and part number of items.
2. Place OPS order listing the normal quantity, unit, parts number,
   description.
3. check box in OPS for "order for pick up"
4. OPS will give a purchase order in the amount needed to pick up the items at
   the local store
5. Return the receipt as the "packing slip"

Reimbursement for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
========================================

UCD policy strongly discourages out-of-pocket expenses. However, emergency
expenses may be unavoidable due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., no access
to a Purchase Order after MAE office hours; emergency purchase; Department
Purchase Order not accepted by a store/vendor).

Out-of-pocket expenses must be PRE-APPROVED by the instructor and must be
deemed necessary for the capstone design project.

**Total out-of-pocket purchases (including tax and shipping cost) must not
exceed $500 per receipt.**

- Complete an Engineering Reimbursement Request form
  (http://mae.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ExpenseReimbursement.pdf)
  and obtain instructorâ€™s approval.
- Save and sign the original receipts if signature specimen is not already on
  the receipt.
- Submit the completed form, along with original receipts, to one of the MAE
  staff, 2132 Bainer Office.
