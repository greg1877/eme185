OPS User Registration
=====================

Kerberos ID and phone number (cell phone preferably) for OPS user registration
to MAE staff.

Order for Supplies and Consumables using a Department Purchase Order (DPO)
==========================================================================

Applicable to Store Pickup, FAX/Internet Order, Credit Card Order

- Obtain approval and correct account # for the order from the instructor.
- Submit a complete OPS order via http://ops.engineering.ucdavis.edu/home.aspx.
  Order will e-route to the instructor and the MAE staff for approvals.
- Include in the OPS order: # of items, unit price, item/catalog #.  Attach a
  price quotation or screen shot of product information if needed.
- If you have a large list of items from an online vendor, save the order in
  CART with your exact items in it and provide your account login/pswd to Lyra
  in Shared Services.
- Include shipping/handling charges when you calculate the total order for
  budgeting purposes.  Charges may vary depending on delivery method (regular
  ground vs. overnight).  RUSH order will incur extra shipping costs. For RUSH
  shipment,  obtain approval from your instructor.
- Verify with the vendor that item is in stock and available for shipment
  within the timeframe needed.
- Submit packing slips as soon as possible to process payment of invoices.
- Plan ahead to avoid unnecessary high shipping charges.

Reimbursement for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
========================================

UCD policy strongly discourages out-of-pocket expenses. However, emergency
expenses may be unavoidable due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., no access
to a Purchase Order after MAE office hours; emergency purchase; Department
Purchase Order not accepted by a store/vendor).

Out-of-pocket expenses must be PRE-APPROVED by the instructor and must be
deemed necessary for the capstone design project.

**Total out-of-pocket purchases (including tax and shipping cost) must not exceed
$500 per receipt.**

- Complete an Engineering Reimbursement Request form
  (http://mae.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ExpenseReimbursement.pdf)
  and obtain instructorâ€™s approval.
- Save and sign the original receipts if signature specimen is not already on the receipt.
- Submit the completed form, along with original receipts, to one of the MAE staff, 2132 Bainer Office.

Tips
====

- Plan your purchases well in advance to avoid rush orders and unnecessary high
  shipping charges.
