Reports
=======

The reports, drawings, and other materials that will need to be submitted
during the project and their approximate due dates are as follows:

1. Design Project Proposal, Specifications and Objective Report - due 2-3 weeks
   into course
2. Preliminary Design Report including Preliminary Machine Architecture - due
   near end of Winter Quarter
3. Weekly Project Progress Summaries – during the Fall Quarter, due each week
   at laboratory starting the week after the Design Project Proposal is
   submitted and not including the weeks that the Preliminary Design Report and
   Preliminary Machine Architecture reports are due.
4. Interim Memos/Reports (oral and/or written) - as needed.
5. Final Design Project Report - due time will be announced when the critical
   design review schedule is announced and it will be at least 24 hours before
   critical design review (end of Winter Quarter)

    a. Summary Report
    b. Layout Drawing(s)
    c. Bill of Materials
    d. Calculation Notebook

Please note that each report should be standalone.  You certainly may refer to
earlier reports, but each report should provide adequate information to allow a
reader to fully understand what is being presented and why.  The reports should
be directed to other technical personnel, but those without detailed knowledge
of the project.

Additionally, you will be required to make several professional presentations
as follows:

1. During the Winter Quarter, each group will meet with the Instructor and
   Teaching Assistant(s) during laboratory to discuss the project proposal,
   project progress, and their design concept selection.  These meetings will
   be arranged as the quarter progresses.  It is essential that the design
   concept be selected and adequately developed by the end of the Winter
   Quarter to ensure that the project progresses adequately through the Spring
   Quarter.
2. Towards the end of Winter Quarter, a session will be scheduled for project
   presentations to the entire class.  Groups will present their design
   concepts and will justify their final selected concept.  The presentations
   will occur will be during the laboratory time.  The presentations will be 8
   minutes comprised of an overview of the project and selected design concept.
   There will 2 minutes for questions.  This presentation will be good practice
   for a high level presentation in industry (for example, to high level
   executives).  All students are required to attend this session, and will
   provide a critique of each other groups' presentation.  Attendance will be
   taken and absences will be reflected in the student's grade.
3. Prior to item 2., each group will be scheduled for a special ½ hour meeting
   with Instructor and TAs to present their design concepts, etc.  The goal is
   to ensure that adequate process is used to select the concept.
4. Weekly project summary presentations starting in the Spring Quarter that
   will include work performed during the previous week, work to be completed
   in the following week, and project status with respect to the detailed
   schedule discussed in the sections below.  These will be arranged with your
   faculty mentor.
5. Poster session with the entire class during a specially scheduled session
   during approximately the last week of the Spring Quarter.  All students are
   required to attend the poster session.  Attendance will be taken and
   absences will be reflected in the student's grade.  Please note that
   participation at the Design Showcase will likely replace the special
   session.
6. Critical Design Review to the instructor/faculty mentor, teaching
   assistant(s) and project sponsors at the end of the project.  These are
   scheduled at 1-hour intervals.  The groups will have a total of 45 minutes
   for their 30-minute presentation and 15 minutes for questions.  Attendance
   and participation at the Critical Design Review is mandatory and the student
   cannot pass the course without such attendance and participation.  Each
   group is required to provide 2 hard copies in addition to a pdf of their
   final report to my office prior to their critical design review; due time
   will be announced when the critical design review schedule is announced and
   it will be at least 24 hours before the critical design review.  The
   critical design reviews will take place in 1016 Academic Surge.  Computer
   projection is available.  The presentation is intended to provide details of
   your final design including analysis, etc.  We are not concerned with the
   path to the final design (i.e., initial concepts, etc.).  As such the
   presentation differs considerably from the Winter Quarter class
   presentations.  The intent of critical design reviews is to insure that the
   proper methods were used in analyses and that the design is valid and
   valuable - i.e., it meets specifications, it can be manufactured, etc.
   There also will be a white board available.

Design Project Proposal, Specifications And Objective Report
============================================================

The Design Project Proposal, Specifications and Objective Report should contain
the following:

1. A problem statement or definition.
2. A list of preliminary design specifications.
3. An objective statement.

State and define your problem as clearly as you can. If your proposal deals
with the smaller component of a larger problem, discuss your problems
significance relative to the total system. List as many design specifications
as you can at this time including such aspects as capacities, speeds, size,
weight, cost, etc. as well as any other specific and/or general requirements
and specifications for your design. State your objective in terms of what you
expect to complete by the end of each quarter. Add other information that is
deemed necessary to "sell" your proposal. Your instructor will evaluate your
report to determine the size and scope of your project, and if the objectives
are both well thought out and feasible.

Preliminary Design Report
=========================

The Preliminary Design Report discusses the initial part of the design process
as related to your project.  Specifically, the report will summarize the
information that you have collected or identify additional information
necessary to collect.  It should list the alternative solutions that you have
conceived for the design solution to the project.  This shall include sketches
of each alternative in addition to trade off analyses.  Finally, you should
provide preliminary information on the design concept selected.  Your report
should include preliminary calculations and additional sketches used in
arriving at your selection and feasibility test results if applicable.  A
lengthy report is not desired.  The primary purpose of this report is to
document the design concept selection and to ensure adequate progress.  You
should additionally include a preliminary schedule of the project in a GANT
format.

The report will also include the Preliminary Machine Architecture, i.e., this
report is aimed at presenting the system concept architecture as well, which
will allow for the division of individual efforts.  The system architecture
will be presented through preliminary layout drawings of the machine,
discussion of the various subsystems, and discussion of the interface between
the various subsystems.  This report will ensure that work will progress
smoothly into the Spring Quarter.

Weekly Project Progress Summaries
=================================

As stated above, these reports are due each week during the Winter Quarter at
laboratory starting the week after the Design Project Proposal is submitted,
and not including the week that the Preliminary Design Report is due.  These
reports are each limited to 1 page maximum, and should concisely describe the
activities in the previous week and the intended activities for the following
week.  A list of bulleted sentences is recommended.

Interim Memos/Reports
=====================

These may be required at times during the project for interim design reviews,
to clarify issues, and to present interesting findings.  These reports may be
used to complement the weekly meetings during Spring Quarter.  These will be
discussed with your faculty mentors and/or industry sponsors.

Project Summary Poster
======================

A project poster will be developed towards the end of the Spring Quarter that
effectively communicates a summary of the project.  While each project’s poster
will differ, example posters will be provided that can be used as a guide.

Final Design Report
===================

The final design report will consist of the following components:

a. Summary Report
b. Layout Drawing(s)
c. Bill of Materials
d. Calculation Notebook

Summary Report
--------------

This may be brief but should include the items as discussed to follow.  Review
and describe the basic features of your design and any features that you feel
are novel. Describe how your design works. Point out specific attributes that
you feel extremely positive about, and note aspects that are weaknesses that
you would change in re-design.  Discuss any work that you feel still needs to
be performed and other changes that would improve the design.  Discuss how the
design will be assembled as well as your choice of materials and manufacturing
processes.

Layout Drawings
---------------

You should refer to a good engineering graphics text for examples of layout
drawings.  The layout drawing is drawn to scale and must show the shape, size,
and position of all parts. It should show how the parts fit together and if
they will function properly. The design details are worked out on this drawing.
The designer additionally uses the layout drawing to show and sell his design
and ideas to his management; it is used by drafts-people to prepare detailed
part drawings and an assembly drawing; it is used by manufacturing engineers to
determine manufacturing processes and costs.  How detailed should it be? It
must be adequately complete so that it can meet the above uses. If it is not
necessary to ask how the design works or what a particular part looks like,
etc., then the layout is adequate.

Bill of Materials
-----------------

The Bill of Materials or Parts List is a tabular list of all of the parts,
components, subassemblies, etc. that constitute the design.  Both manufactured
items and purchased items are included.  The list should include part numbers,
part names, number required, material, whether purchased or fabricated, and if
purchased, the name and part number of the supplier and the cost.  The Bill of
Materials is used for such aspects as: insuring that all parts are on hand when
production begins, to ensure that detailed drawings are prepared for all
components, for planning of the manufacturing process, etc.  Cost estimates are
also typically included in the report for fabricated parts.

Calculation Notebook
--------------------

This should include a complete record of all work and calculations for your
design.

Design Prototype
================

Based on the current two-quarter sequence, it is anticipated that a prototype
machine may be fabricated for some projects. In some cases, only critical
machine components will actually be built. The prototype will be demonstrated
as part of the final design review and at the poster session.
