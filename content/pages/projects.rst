Instructions
============

The following list of project proposals have been submitted by a variety
industry, education, and research sponsors. You will have the opportunity to
vote on your top five choices in the `CATME Team Maker survey
<https://www.catme.org/login/>`_. The instructors will then pair a project to a
team of 4 to 5 students based on the survey data. Please take note of the
following guidelines:

- Be sure to note any additional requirements like sponsor location,
  communication needs (language, timezone), ability to travel to the sponsor's
  location for meetings or work, etc. Do not select projects that have
  requirements you can't meet.
- Many of these projects could provide leads towards internship and employment
  opportunities.
- All questions you have about the projects (clarity, more info, etc) should be
  asked on Canvas discussions so that everyone in the class can benefit from
  the answers.
- There are 21 proposals, but only about 17 projects will be selected.
