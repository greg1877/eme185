Course Philosophy
-----------------

This course differs from almost all other courses that you have taken at the
university in that there is no predetermined list of theories, facts, or
physical laws that you are expected to learn and master. The sole objective of
the design project course is to provide you with an opportunity to use your own
skills and knowledge to solve an engineering design problem. This experience
will help you make the transition from school to work; i.e., to bridge the gap
between theory and applications.

You are expected to attend every class, to use your own initiative to plan your
own outside work schedule, both in class and outside of class, and to complete
various major design project phases by their deadlines. Your instructors should
be viewed as consultants and not as a taskmasters; they will not direct your
work effort or make your decisions, but are there to assist you with technical
engineering problems.

In 185A, a one-hour lecture is used each week to present material related to
the design process. Additionally, a 3-hour studio is used for group
activities, supplemental lecture material, and individual group meetings with
the instructors. Groups will follow the design process in their respective
projects. Groups are expected to meet regularly outside of formal class hours.
Groups will additionally meet with their instructors on a regular basis during
the quarter for direction, group presentations, and design reviews. Based on
the nature of the project, some groups will also meet with industry sponsors on
a regular basis. Towards the end of the quarter, sessions will be scheduled for
project presentations to the entire class.

In 185B, each group will register for a block of time for both meetings with
the instructor and to allow a common time for group meetings. Also, each group
will meet weekly with their project's faculty mentor. Additionally, many of the
projects will require group meetings with their corporate sponsors, and these
are additionally arranged based on everyone's schedules. There will be no
formal lecture time scheduled for 185B. During approximately the last week of
185B class, the teams will present a poster at the College of Engineering's
Design Showcase.

Student's Role & Responsibility
-------------------------------

Each student should view their role as that of an engineer as part of a design
team charged with the responsibility of managing and completing a design
project. As such you must do whatever is necessary to carry out this
responsibility. Specifically, your group must carry a design project from the
conception stage through the presentation stage. You are also responsible for
all written and oral reports and materials required by your instructor. Some
projects may require the fabrication of feasibility test components and/or
first generation prototype components. This may be accomplished through a
combination of student work in the engineering student faculty shop and/or the
corporate sponsor accepting this responsibility.

Instructors' Role & Responsibility
----------------------------------

Your instructors mentor have two primary responsibilities. First, they will
serve as an engineering consultant to the design project teams. In this
capacity, they expect to be kept informed of your project progress, have
discussions about design concepts and problems, point out appropriate reference
materials, suggest analysis methods, etc. They will not make engineering
decisions that they feel are rightly the responsibility of the design project
engineers, and they will generally play the role of devil's advocate in your
decision making process. Every student should keep in mind that the best time
to use your consultant is before your problem becomes unmanageable.

Your instructors' second responsibility is to evaluate your performance and
your design solution to the project. This is done by periodic review of your
progress (written and/or oral reports) and especially by evaluation of your
Final Design Project Report at the end of the second quarter. It should be
noted that each project's sponsor will provide feedback that may contribute to
final grading as well.

Textbook
========

The majority of preparation and readings for the lectures will come from:

*Product Design and Development*, Ulrich, K.T. and Eppinger, S.D., 5th Edition,
McGraw-Hill 2011. ISBN 978-0073404776 [`Book Information`_]

The textbook is optional, but you should have at least one copy per team for
reference purposes. Note that there is also a `MIT Open Courseware class`_ that
goes with this book. There are a lot of useful materials available.

Assignments & Grades
====================

You will receive a single grade for EME185A and EME185B (total of 8 units) that
will be reported to you via the registrar at the end of the spring quarter.
After the winter quarter your grade will show as "IP" until the end of the
spring quarter. All of the work in this class is graded per group, with each
team member receiving the same grade as the group. Your peer evaluations may
affect you individual grade.

Grades will be available in the canvas.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted
per business day late** on all assignments.

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **EME 185A A02 WQ 2017**.

We will be using several features in Canvas:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
   will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
   to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.
Assignments
   The electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.
Discussion
   This discussion board is the first place to ask questions about the class.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Communication
=============

This class requires a lot of communication: among your team, with your
sponsors, with your mentors, and with the instructors. This can quickly get
unmanageable, especially for the instructors' email inboxes. So here are some
simple rules to follow with respect to communication:

Canvas Discussions
   This is the first place to ask questions. Use this forum to ask questions
   that are general for the class. Try to restructure your less general
   questions into general ones so you can ask here. This minimizes the number
   of times a question has to be answered and allows both students and
   instructors to collectively answer questions.
Email
   Use email for individualized communication, i.e. for questions about project
   specifics or other personal needs. Email your TA first before you email the
   primary instructor. Do not copy any of the instructors into your email
   conversations among your team or with your sponsors. We are your technical
   consultants, only email us when you have a specific question that you need
   help answering. Lastly, all emails to the instructors must prepend
   "[EME185]" to their subject line.
Class
   You will get to meet with the instructors during the studio time. You must
   prepare an `AIO`_ for the meeting. You will get at least 15 minutes of time
   from your TA and 15 minutes every other week with the primary instructor.
Office Hours
   The primary instructor will hold office hours in which you can schedule up
   to a 30 minute block for your team to meet.
Appointments
   You may schedule an appointment with any of the instructors if all of the
   above doesn't work for some reason. Use this as a last resort.
