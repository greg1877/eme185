:title: Memos
:status: hidden

In general, you will create weekly memos that document your team's
accomplishments and progress. The memos should all be turned in to Smartsite
Assignments by midnight on the respective due date (typically Fridays).

Each memo should stand on its own and you will be able to use the content as a
base to develop the reports. In addition to turning in the assignment, you are
welcome to share these memos with your project sponsor(s) for feedback but the
main audience are the course instructors.

The memos should have no more than two pages of main content and an optional
two pages of appendices. The "main content" is defined as the essential text,
figures, tables, etc. to tell your story. Additionally, feel free to link to
rich media: videos, websites, demos, etc. This main content should stand on its
own without the appendices. The appendices can include figures, tables,
drawings, renderings, source code, and other relevant material to support the
story told in your main content pages if the reader desires to understand
further details. The appendices should not be required to understand the main
content.

- Each memo must be submitted as a single PDF document made up of 8.5" x 11"
  sheets to Smartsite. **You will be docked points if you submit a format other
  than PDF.**
- Your group is free to use any software you prefer to prepare the documents.
  [#]_.
- They should be treated as a professional documents and formatted as such.
- The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
  another engineering colleague or engineering management, and/or your project
  sponsor.

.. [#] I recommend collaborative editors for team work like Google Docs,
   ShareLaTeX, OverLeaf, SageMathCloud, Etherpad, etc.

Memo 1: Project Selection [Due: Friday, January 8, 2016]
========================================================

This "memo" will be in the form of a CATME Team Maker Survey, a cover letter,
and your résumé. You will receive a notice via email and will need to fill out
the survey on the CATME website. Your cover letter and résumé should be turned
in via Smartsite as a single PDF. **Note that your résumé should not exceed
more that two pages.** Prepend the résumé with a 1 page cover letter that
explains why you should be chosen for the projects that you have selected on
the CATME survey.

The CATME Survey can be accessed via this link:

https://www.catme.org/

Resources for developing your résumé and cover letter can be found on the
`resources page <{filename}/pages/resources.rst>`_.

Memo 2: Needs and Specs [Due: Friday, January 15, 2016]
=======================================================

The purpose of this memo is to summarize what you have learned from the
stakeholders in your project, in particular your sponsors' needs and desired
outcomes. You should use the initial conversations with the sponsor to learn
much as possible. **As soon as the projects are assigned you should initiate
contact with your sponsor for an interview.**

For the first part of the memo, the purpose will be to communicate the
sponsor's needs in your own language as you understand them. We recommend using
the techniques explained in Chapter 5 and in class to generate these needs.

Secondly, you should show preliminary target specifications based on the needs
that you have found. Techniques for generating the specifications from the
needs are provided in Chapter 6, where the first portion explains getting to
target specs.

Suggestions of what may be helpful to include:

- Summary of the problem, i.e. the mission statement.
- The organized identified needs.
- The organized target specifications.
- Reflections on the process and the results.
