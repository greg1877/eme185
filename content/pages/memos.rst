:title: Memos
:status: hidden

In general, you will create weekly memos that document your team's
accomplishments and progress. The memos should all be turned in to Canvas
Assignments by midnight on the respective due date (typically Fridays).

Each memo should stand on its own and you will be able to use the content as a
base to develop the reports. In addition to turning in the assignment, you are
welcome to share these memos with your project sponsor(s) for feedback but the
main audience you should address are the course instructors.

The memos should have no more than two pages of main content and an optional
additional two pages of appendices. The "main content" is defined as the
essential text, figures, tables, etc. to tell your story. Additionally, feel
free to link to rich media: videos, websites, demos, etc. This main content
should stand on its own without the appendices. The appendices can include
figures, tables, drawings, renderings, analyses, source code, and other
relevant material to support the story told in your main content pages if the
reader desires to understand further details. The appendices should not be
required to understand the main content.

- Each memo must be submitted as a single PDF document made up of 8.5" x 11"
  sheets to Canvas. **You will be docked points if you submit a format other
  than PDF.**
- Your group is free to use any software you prefer to prepare the documents.
  [#]_.
- They should be treated as a professional documents and formatted as such.
- The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
  another engineering colleague or engineering management, and/or your project
  sponsor.

.. [#] I recommend collaborative editors for team work like Google Docs,
   ShareLaTeX, OverLeaf, SageMathCloud, Etherpad, etc.

Memo 1: Project Selection [Due: Friday, January 13, 2017]
=========================================================

This "memo" will be in the form of a CATME Team Maker Survey and your résumé.
You will receive a notice via email for CATME and will need to fill out the
survey on the CATME website. Your résumé should be turned in via Canvas as a
single PDF. **Note that your résumé should not exceed more that two pages.**

The CATME Survey can be accessed via this link:

https://www.catme.org/

Resources for developing your résumé can be found on the
`resources page <{filename}/pages/resources.rst>`_.

CATME takes into account all of the information that you provide it and
attempts to algorithmically select optimal teams to align schedules, distribute
similar and dissimilar qualities, and ensure a project of you choice. We will
read your your résumé to get to know you a bit better and to provide you
feedback for improving it for the upcoming `Engineering Career Fair`_ (Jan 25).

Memo 2: Needs and Specs [Due: Friday, January 20, 2017]
=======================================================

The purpose of this memo is to summarize what you have learned from the
stakeholders in your project, in particular your sponsors' needs and desired
outcomes. You should use the initial conversations with the sponsor to learn
much as possible. **As soon as the projects are assigned you should initiate
contact with your sponsor for an interview.**

For the first part of the memo, the purpose will be to communicate the
sponsor's needs in your own language as you understand them. We recommend using
the techniques explained in Chapter 5 and in class to generate these needs.

Secondly, you should show preliminary target specifications based on the needs
that you have found. Techniques for generating the specifications from the
needs are provided in Chapter 6, where the first portion explains getting to
target specs.

Suggestions of what may be helpful to include:

- Summary of the problem, i.e. the mission statement.
- The organized identified needs.
- The organized target specifications.
- Reflections on the process and the results.

Memo 3: Concept Generation [Due: Friday, February 3, 2017]
==========================================================

The purpose of this memo is to summarize your initial exploration of external
and internal concepts. Using the needs and specifications that you developed in
the previous weeks and those that you continue to identify during your
interactions with stakeholders, you should begin to generate concepts that can
meet the specifications.

The external concepts should be obtained through extensive searches in product
information on the web, patents, discussions with experts, literature searches,
etc. Specifications from external concepts should be compared to specifications
you have derived from your needs.

You should also generate a large number of internal concepts both individually
and as a group. The more concepts you can generate, the better. Also remember
to suspend judgment during this process. The goal is to explore all
possibilities regardless of how crazy they seem.

The memo should present the findings of the preliminary external and internal
concept generation process. We highly recommend making heavy use of graphical
means to communicate the concepts along with accompanying textual information.
All of your concepts will not fit into the standard memo format, so feel free
to make the appendices longer as necessary to show the breadth of your work for
this particular memo.

You are welcome to use any process to generate concepts, but we recommend
following the processes presented in class and in the text as a starting point.

Suggestions of what to include:

- Problem decomposition (function diagrams, etc.)
- Identification of critical sub-problems.
- Summary of external concepts and how they influenced your internal concepts.
- Summary of internal concepts along with the main themes.
- An organized depiction of the developed concepts (e.g. tables, charts,
  classification trees, combination tables, etc.)
- Reflection on the process and the results.

Memo 4: Preliminary Analysis [Due: Friday, Feburary 17, 2017]
=============================================================

To select your final design concept, you will need to determine if the
different concepts meet your target specifications. This typically requires
preliminary engineering analysis and/or testing to make those decisions. For
many specifications a "back-of-the-envelope_" calculation is sufficient for
decision making and is preferred because it takes little time. This memo should
detail the preliminary analyses for any concepts that need to be evaluated.
Analysis is not required for all of your concepts. To reduce the number of
concepts feel free to screen them at this point. If you believe testing is
required to make your final concept selection you will need to explain the
necessary testing and a plan to get that done.

Suggestions of what to include:

- Descriptions of the methods needed to determine if concepts meet target
  specifications.
- Screened concepts that need analyses or testing for further scoring.
- Preliminary analyses that shows whether concepts meet or fail to meet target
  specifications.
- Plans or results from any required testing.
- Any other relevant analyses that you have done.

Memo 5: Concept Selection [Due: Friday, March 3, 2017]
======================================================

The purpose of this memo is to show that you have narrowed down your concepts
and have a solution that you want to move forward with. Ideally, you have one
concept at this point, but if not, you should be down to a very minimal set of
choices and have a strong justification as to why you are having a hard time
deciding. Finally, you should show that your selected concept has a very high
probability of meeting your target specs and solving your problem.

Suggestions of what to include:

- A detailed description of your selected concept.
- Proof that indicates this concept will meet all or most of your target
  specifications. If it doesn't meet all of them, justification as to why is
  needed.
- Justification for your elimination of the abandoned concepts.
- A description of your selection process to document why you ended up with the
  selected choice.
- Any screening or scoring charts/tables/graphs, etc.
